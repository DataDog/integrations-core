# Cloudflare API Shield

## Overview

[Cloudflare API Shield][1] is a comprehensive solution designed to protect, manage, and monitor Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) against various security threats and operational challenges.

This integration collects HTTP request and API Shield Audit Logs, channeling them into Datadog for analysis. Leveraging the built-in logs pipeline, these logs are parsed and enriched, enabling search and analysis.

Channels should rarely change on client devices unless there is interference or frequent AP (access point) channel changes. This may indicate brief disconnections or degraded performance while the Wi-Fi interference renegotiates the connection. \n\nThis may indicate\n1. Increased interference and crowded Wi-Fi channels in dense environments like offices and public settings. \n2. A misconfigured or unstable network causing client devices to struggle with finding a stable channel\n3. A client-side issue, caused by a faulty driver or unstable NIC (Network Interface Card)\n\n---\n\n###  Related links\n\n* [Host Map](https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/map)\n* [Wi-Fi Dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists?q=Wi-Fi)\n* [Monitor Documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/)\n\n### Who should be notified?\n\nAssign the appropriate notification handle for this alert (e.g., `@slack-infra`, `@pagerduty-core-systems`):  \n`@your-team-handle`",

# Agent Check: wlan

## Overview

This check monitors Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks based on the [IEEE 802.11][1] standards, commonly referred to as Wi-Fi.

It collects key Wi-Fi metrics, including Access Point (AP) information such as [SSID][2] and [BSSID][3] (as tags), signal quality telemetry like [RSSI][4] and [Noise][5], transmission rate, and transitions count ([Roaming][6] and [Swapping][7] between APs, for example). These metrics help proactively identify overall wireless network issues, such as overloaded access points, as well as retrospective troubleshooting of poor network performance on individual hosts.

## Setup

### Prerequisite

#### Windows

Starting from Windows 11 24H2 (Fall 2024), according to [Changes to API behavior for Wi-Fi access and location][16], WLAN Check (which uses Windows Wlan APIs), requires user or administrator consent. If the host's `Settings > Privacy & security > Location` has not been enabled, this WLAN check will fail to report WLAN/Wi-Fi telemetry.

The following settings need to be enabled:
- **Settings > Privacy & security > Location > Location services**
- **Settings > Privacy & security > Location > Let desktop apps access your location**

You can check if the Location API is not disabled by running `netsh wlan show interface` command, which would fail to report any Wi-Fi interface connection even if you are connected.

An administrator can also enable these settings using the following:
- [Registry][17]
- [Group Policy][18]
- [InTune][19]


#### macOS

Just like on Windows, Wi-Fi telemetry collection on macOS requires user consent through location services. However, unlike Windows, macOS does not provide a well-defined mechanism for administrators to enable location access for specific processes like the Datadog Agent at scale.

To work around this, customers can adapt the `add_datadog_agent_to_plist.sh` script provided in **Appendix** to grant location access to the Agent process. This script requires **root** access and can be deployed across an enterprise Mac fleet using an MDM solution like Jamf.

### Installation

The WLAN check is included in the [Datadog Agent][8], but is not configured. Please see the next section to configure the check.

### Configuration

The configuration is located in the `wlan.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][9]. See the [sample wlan.d/conf.yaml][10] for all available configuration options. When you are done editing the configuration file, [restart the Agent][11] to load the new configuration.

#### Tags

The check automatically tags emitted metrics with SSID, BSSID, MAC Address, Wi-Fi type (A, B, G, N, AC), Wi-Fi Authentication (Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3). As noted in [Getting Started with Tags][12] uppercase characers in tag values are replaced by lowercase characters and special characters are replaced with underscores.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][13] and look for `wlan` under the **Checks** section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][14] for a list of metrics that this integration provides.

### Events

WLAN does not include any events.

## Terminology

### Roaming

`Roaming` refers to a device's ability to seamlessly switch from one Wi-Fi access point to another as it moves around, without losing its connection. This happens when the device finds a stronger or more reliable signal from a different access point, ensuring continuous internet access. A `Roaming` event is detected when the *BSSID* of the connected router or AP has been changed but its *SSID* is still the same.  When the *SSID* of the router or AP is not broadcasted, roaming detection is not possible. When a `Roaming` event is detected, the `system.wlan.roaming_events` metric is then incremented. Switching to a router with a different *SSID* is not considered to be `Roaming`.

### Channel Swap

`Channel Swap` refers to the process of changing the Wi-Fi channel a router or access point is using to broadcast its signal. This is done to improve signal strength, reduce interference, or optimize performance, especially in areas with many competing Wi-Fi networks. The `Channel Swap` event is detected when the *BSSID* of the connected router or access point is the same but its channel has been changed. When the *BSSID* of the connected router or access point has been changed (which makes it a `Roaming` event if the router or access point has the same *SSID*) it is not considered a `Channel Swap` event even if the channel has been changed.

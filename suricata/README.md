## Overview

[Suricata][4] is a high performance, open source network analysis and threat detection software used by most private and public organizations, and embedded by major vendors to protect their assets.

This integration provides enrichment and visualization for Alert, Anomaly, HTTP, DNS, FTP, FTP_DATA, TLS, TFTP, SMB, SSH, Flow, RDP, DHCP, and ARP log types. It helps to visualize detailed insights into Alerts, Anomaly, network connections, DNS, and DHCP activity, as well as detailed network protocol analysis in the integration's out-of-the-box dashboards.

## Setup

### Installation

To install the Suricata integration, run the following Agent installation command and follow the steps below. For more information, see the [Integration Management][5] documentation.

**Note**: This step is not necessary for Agent versions >= 7.54.0.

For Linux, run:
  ```shell
  sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent integration install datadog-suricata==1.0.0
  ```

### Configuration

#### Log collection

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. Enable it in the `datadog.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `suricata.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Suricata logs.

   See the [sample suricata.d/conf.yaml][6] for available configuration options.

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: file
       path: /var/log/suricata/eve.json
       service: suricata
       source: suricata
   ```
   **Note**: Make sure you have `eve-log` output logging enabled in the `suricata.yaml` file of the Suricata application, and that you've address the following points:
   1. In the `suricata.yaml` file, keep `filetype` parameter as `regular` in `eve-log` configurations.
   2. The default path of Suricata's output files is `/var/log/suricata`, and the default filename is `eve.json`. If you have changed the default path and filename, update the `path` parameter in your `conf.yaml` file accordingly.

3. [Restart the Agent][3].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `suricata` under the Checks section.

## Troubleshooting

If you see a **Permission denied** error while monitoring the log files, give the `dd-agent` user read permission on them.

  ```shell
  sudo chown -R dd-agent:dd-agent /var/log/suricata/eve.json
  ```

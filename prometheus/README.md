# Prometheus Integration

## Overview

Extract custom metrics from any prometheus endpoints.

**Note:** All the metrics retrieved by this integration will be considered as custom metrics.

## Setup

### Installation

The Prometheus check is packaged with the Agent starting version 6.1.0.

### Configuration

Edit the `prometheus.d/conf.yaml` file to add your different prometheus instances you want to retrieve metrics from.

Each instance is at least composed of:

* a `prometheus_url` that points to the metric route (**Note:** must be unique)
* a `namespace` that will be prepended to all metrics (to avoid metrics name collision)
* a list of `metrics` that you want to retrieve as custom metrics, for each metric you can either simply add it to the list `- metric_name` or renaming it like `- metric_name: renamed`. It's also possible to use a `*` wildcard such as `- metric*` that would fetch all matching metrics (to use with caution as it can potentially send a lot of custom metrics)

There is also a couple of more advanced settings (ssl, labels joining, custom tags,...) that are documented in the [example configuration][2]

If you are monitoring an off-the-shelf software and you think it would deserve an official integration, have a look at `kube-proxy` for an example, and don't hesitate to contribute.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][1] and look for `prometheus` under the Checks section.

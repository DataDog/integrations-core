  # If your prometheus endpoint is secured, here are the settings to configure it
  #
  # Can either be only the path to the certificate and thus you should specify the private key

  # ssl_cert: "/path/to/cert"
  #
  # Needed if the certificate does not include the private key
  #
  # /!\ The private key to your local certificate must be unencrypted.

  # The path to the trusted CA used for generating custom certificates
  # ssl_ca_cert: "/path/to/cacert"

  # Set a timeout for the prometheus query, defaults to 10

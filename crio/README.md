# Agent Check: CRI-O

## Overview

This check monitors [CRI-O][1].

## Setup

### Installation

The integration relies on the `--enable-metrics` option of CRI-O that is disabled by default, when enabled metrics will be exposed at `127.0.0.1:9090/metrics`.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `crio.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your
   Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your CRI-O performance data.
   See the [sample crio.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][3]

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `crio` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

CRI-O collect metrics about the count and latency of operations that are done by the runtime.
Datadog-CRI-O integration is also collecting CPU and memory usage of CRI-O golang binary itself.

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][7] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Service Checks

CRI-O includes a service check about the reachability of the metrics endpoint.

### Events

CRI-O does not include any events.

Always use the database instance's resolved hostname for metrics regardless of how dbm and disable_generic_tags is set. For non-dbm customers or users of disable_generic_tags, this change will result in the host tag having a different value than before. It is possible that dashboards and monitors using the integration's metrics will need to be updated if they relied on the faulty host tagging.

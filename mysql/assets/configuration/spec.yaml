              A list of custom queries used to retrieve custom metrics.

              The following fields are expected:

              query:
                The SQL query to execute. It can be a simple statement, or a multi-line script.
              columns:
                A list representing each column, ordered sequentially from left to right.
                The number of columns must be equal to the number of columns returned in the `query`.

                Each column is an object with the following fields:

                name:
                  The suffix to append to `mysql.` to form the full metric name.
                  If `type` is `tag`, this column is considered a tag and applied to every metric
                  collected by this query.
                type:
                  The submission method (gauge, monotonic_count, etc.).
                  Use the 'tag' type to tag each metric in the row with the name and value
                  of the item in this column.
                  Use the 'count' type to perform aggregation for queries that return multiple
                  rows with the same or no tags.
              tags: (optional)
                A list of tags to apply to each metric.

            value:
              type: array
              items:

                  Note that this runs a heavy query against your database to compute the relevant metrics
                  for all your existing schemas. Due to the nature of these calls, if you have a
                  high number of tables and schemas, this may have a negative impact on your database performance.

# RiakCS Check

![RiakCS Dashboard][1]

## Overview

Capture RiakCS metrics in Datadog to:

- Visualize key RiakCS metrics.
- Correlate RiakCS performance with the rest of your applications.

## Setup

### Installation

The RiakCS check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your RiakCS nodes.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `riakcs.yamld/conf.` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3]. See the [sample riakcs.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options:

   ```yaml
   init_config:

   instances:
     ## @param access_id - string - required
     ## Enter you RiakCS access key.
     #
     - access_id: "<ACCESS_KEY>"

       ## @param access_secret - string - required
       ## Enter the corresponding RiakCS access secret.
       #
       access_secret: "<ACCESS_SECRET>"
   ```

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][6] and look for `riakcs` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][7] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

For RiackCS v2.1+, the default metrics collected by this integrations includes most S3 API metrics as well as memory stats. Some have been excluded:

- bucket*acl*(get|put)
- object*acl*(get|put)
- bucket*policy*(get|put|delete)
- _in_(one|total)
- _time_error_\*
- \_time_100

Any of these excluded metrics in addition to many others (there are over 1000 to choose from) can be added by specifying them in the
`riakcs.d/conf.yaml` configuration file with the `metrics` key in the `instance_config`; the value should be a list of metric names.

[See the complete list of metrics available][8].

### Events

The RiackCS check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

**riakcs.can_connect**:

Returns CRITICAL if the Agent cannot connect to the RiakCS endpoint to collect metrics, otherwise OK.

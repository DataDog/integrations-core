# Agent Check: Snowflake

## Overview

This check monitors [Snowflake][1] through the Datadog Agent. Snowflake is a SaaS-analytic data warehouse and runs completely on cloud infrastructure. 
This integration monitors credit, billing, and storage usage, query history, and more.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][2] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The Snowflake check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package.
No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `snowflake.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your snowflake performance data. See the [sample snowflake.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

    **Note**: By default, this integration monitors the `SNOWFLAKE` database and `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema.
    This database is available by default and only viewable by users in the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or [any role granted by the ACCOUNTADMIN][8].

2. [Restart the Agent][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `snowflake` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

**NOTE**: Metrics are collected via queries to Snowflake. Queries from the integration are billable by Snowflake.


### Service Checks

`snowflake.can_connect`: Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent cannot authenticate and connect to Snowflake, `OK` otherwise.

### Events

Snowflake does not include any events.

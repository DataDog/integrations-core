# Agent Check: citrix_hypervisor

## Overview

This check monitors [Citrix Hypervisor][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][2] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The Citrix Hypervisor check is included in the [Datadog Agent][3] package.
No additional installation is needed on your server.  
The recommended way to monitor Citrix hypervisors is to install one Datadog Agent on each hypervisor.

#### Datadog user

The Citrix Hypervisor integration requires a user with at least [`read-only`][4] access to monitor the service.

### Configuration

#### Host

1. Edit the `citrix_hypervisor.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Citrix Hypervisor performance data. See the [sample citrix_hypervisor.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][6].

#### Log collection

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. Enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `citrix_hypervisor.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Citrix Hypervisor logs:
    ```yaml
    logs:
    - type: file
      path: /var/log/xensource.log
      source: citrix_hypervisor
    ```
    Change the `path` value and configure it for your environment. See the [sample `citrix_hypervisor.d/conf.yaml` file][5] for all available configuration options.

3. [Restart the Agent][6].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `citrix_hypervisor` under the Checks section.

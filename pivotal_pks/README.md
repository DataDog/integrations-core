# Pivotal Container Service Integration

## Overview

This integration monitors [Pivotal Container Service][1] clusters.

## Setup

Since Datadog already integrates with Kubernetes, it is ready-made to monitor PKS.

### Metric collection

Monitoring PKS requires that you set up the Datadog integration for [Kubernetes][2].

### Log collection

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

The setup is exactly the same as for Kubernetes.
To start collecting logs from all your containers, use your Datadog Agent [environment variables][3].

You can also take advantage of DaemonSets to [automatically deploy the Datadog Agent on all your nodes][4].

Follow the [container log collection steps][5] to learn more about those environment variables and discover more advanced setup options.

## Troubleshooting

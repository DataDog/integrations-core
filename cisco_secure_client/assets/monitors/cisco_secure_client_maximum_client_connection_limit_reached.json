This behavior typically indicates that the ASA is running out of available VPN licenses or experiencing unusually high VPN usage.\n\n**Potential Impact**\n- User connections may end unexpectedly.\n- New VPN sessions may fail to establish.\n- Indicates license exhaustion or high VPN demand.\n\n**Current Metric Value:** **{{value}}**\n**Alert Threshold:** {{threshold}}\n\nImmediate review of AnyConnect license usage and active session count is recommended to prevent user disruption.\n{{/is_alert}}\n\n@example@test.com",

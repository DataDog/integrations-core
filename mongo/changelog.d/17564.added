Emit updated mongodb_instance event when mongo deployment type is refreshed with updates. The mongo deployment type is considered to be updated when
- replica set name is changed
- member role is updated in a replica set, i.e. primary step down/secondary step up or new member joins the replica set
- new shard joins a sharded cluster or new member joins a shard results in mongos shard map updated
Add internal resource tag `dd.internal.resource:database_instance` to mongo metrics.

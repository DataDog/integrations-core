      description: |
        The host (and optional port number) where the mongod instance (or mongos instances for
        a sharded cluster) is running. You can specify a hostname, IP address, or UNIX domain
        socket. Specify as many hosts as appropriate for your deployment topology:

          - For a standalone, specify the hostname of the standalone mongod instance.
          - For a replica set, specify the hostname of a mongod instance as listed in
            the replica set configuration. You need one check instance per mongod instance
            in order to collect replication metrics and events.
          - For a sharded cluster, you need one check instance for each mongod instance in
            each shard (including the configsvr shard) as well as one additional check instance
            that connects to one (or more) mongos node.

        If the port number is not specified, the default port 27017 is used.

        Even if the host is an arbiter node, you still need to provide authentication credentials
        as the check will create an additional connection to the primary in this specific case.

        Do not specify more than one host here unless you are connecting to a mongos instance
        and you want to balance requests performed by the agent to multiple mongos instances.
        
        If you need to monitor multiple mongos instances and are using version 7.39 or later of the Agent, 
        configure the integration to disable directConnection, which is enabled by default starting in 4.0.2. 
        This can be done by setting options.directConnection to 'false'.

        Use `mongodb` to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format. This is the default value.
        In order to leverage the DNS seed list, use a connection_scheme of `mongodb+srv` rather than the standard
        `mongodb`.

        This is also the authentication database to use if a `username` and `password` is set but the `authSource` is not
        specified in `options`. If `database` is not set and the `authSource` is not specified in `options`,
        the check will attempt to authenticate `username` to the admin database.

        NOTE: For monitoring replica set, do not use the replicaSet parameter as the Agent expects to always
        connect to the same host. Instead configure one check instance for each node.

          * `tcmalloc` -  TCMalloc memory allocator
          * `top` - Usage statistics for each collection

        IT Requires `additional_metrics.collection` to be present.
        Metrics such as `mongodb.collection.count` are collected for each named collection and tagged as follows:
         * `db:<DB_NAME>` e.g. `db:<DB_NAME>`
         * `collection:<COLLECTION_NAME>` e.g. `collection:<COLLECTION_NAME>`
        Each collection generates many metrics, up to 8 + the number of indices on the collection for each collection.

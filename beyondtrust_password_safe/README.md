# BeyondTrust Password Safe

## Overview

[BeyondTrust Password Safe][1] is a privileged access management solution designed to securely store, manage, and rotate privileged credentials (like administrative or root passwords) used to access critical systems. It automates password rotation and provides comprehensive session monitoring and recording to help organizations maintain strict control over privileged credentials.

This integration parses and ingest the following types of logs:
- **Password and Session Activities**: Captures events related to password retrievals, password rotations, session requests, approvals, and denials.
- **Managed Systems and Managed Accounts**: Logs information about the addition, modification, or removal of managed systems and accounts.
- **Secret Safe Activities**: Tracks the creation, retrieval, and deletion of secrets stored in the secret safe.
- **Audit Logs**: Tracks activities performed by platform users.

Visualize detailed insights into these logs through out-of-the-box dashboards. Cloud SIEM also provides detection rules to help you monitor and respond to potential security threats effectively.

## Setup

### Log Collection Overview

**Note**: To collect all the log types, configure both log collection methods.

The following table shows the log collection methods, the logs collected, and the dashboards populated for each methods.

### Agent and Event Forwarder Configuration

#### Installation

To install the BeyondTrust Password Safe integration, run the following Agent installation command in your terminal, then complete the configuration steps. For more information, see the [Integration Management][4] documentation.

**Note**: This step is not necessary for Agent version >= 7.69.0.

```shell
sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent integration install datadog-beyondtrust_password_safe==1.0.0
```


#### Log collection

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. Enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `beyondtrust_password_safe.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your logs.

   See the sample [beyondtrust_password_safe.d/conf.yaml][8] for available configuration options.

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: tcp
       port: <PORT>
       source: beyondtrust-password-safe
       service: password-safe
   ```

   **Note**:

   - `PORT`: Port should be similar to the port provided in **Configure log forwarding from BeyondTrust Password Safe via Universal Event Forwarder** section.
   - It is recommended not to change the service and source values, as these parameters are integral to the pipeline's operation.

3. [Restart the Agent][6].

#### Configure log forwarding from BeyondTrust Password Safe through the Universal Event Forwarder

1. Log in to BeyondTrust Password Safe with an Administrator account.
2. In BeyondTrust Password Safe, go to **Configuration > General > Connectors**.
3. From the Connectors panel, click **Create New Connector**.
4. Enter a name for the connector.
5. Select **Universal Event Forwarder** from the list.
6. Click **Create Connector**.
7. Leave Active (yes) enabled.
8. Select **TCP** in the **Available Output Pipelines** dropdown.
9. Enter the IP address where your Datadog Agent is running in the **Host Name** field.
10. Enter the Port on which the Datadog Agent is listening.
11. Select **JSON** in **Available Formatters** dropdown.
12. Select Local0 in **Facility** dropdown.
13. Expand Event Filters, and then enable **BeyondInsight Application Audit** and **Password Safe** options.
14. Click **Create Connector**.

#### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `beyondtrust_password_safe` under the Checks section.

### Audit API Configuration

#### Retrieve Datadog CIDR Range

1. Use an API platform such as Postman, or curl to make a GET request to the [Datadog API endpoint][7].
2. Once you receive the response, locate the **webhooks** section in the JSON. It will look something like this:
   ```json
      "webhooks": {
         "prefixes_ipv4": [
            "0.0.0.0/32",
            ...
         ],
         "prefixes_ipv6": []
         }
   ```
3. From the **prefixes_ipv4** list under the Webhooks section, copy each CIDR entry.

#### Configure API Access Policy and retrieve API Base Endpoint

1. Log in to the BeyondTrust Password Safe using Administrator account.
2. Go to **Configuration > General > API Registrations**.
3. Click **Create API Registration**.
4. Select **API Access Policy** from the dropdown list.
5. Fill out the new API registration details, and set the **Access Token Duration** to 30 minutes.
6. Click **Add Authentication Rule** for each of the CIDR entries retrieved in step "Retrieve Datadog CIDR Range". 
   - For Type, select **CIDR** from the dropdown list.
   - Enter the **CIDR** entry in the CIDR field.
7. Click **Create Rule** and then click **Create Registration**.
8. Copy **API Base Endpoint**.

#### Generate Client ID and Client Secret

1. Log in to the BeyondTrust Password Safe with an Administrator account.
2. Go to **Configuration > Role Based Access > User Management**.
3. Click the **Users** tab to display the list of users in the grid.
4. Click **Create New User**.
5. Select **Add an Application User** from the dropdown list.
6. Add a Username.
7. Under API Access Policy, select the policy created. To create a policy, see [Configure API Access Policy and Retrieve API Base Endpoint](#configure-api-access-policy-and-retrieve-api-base-endpoint).
8. Copy the information from the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields for later use.
9. Click **Create User**.
10. Assign the user to a group that has the **User Audits (Read-Only)** permission. To create a group, see the [BeyondTrust documentation][2].
    - Click the vertical ellipsis for the user, and then select **View User Details**.
    - From the User Details pane, click **Groups**.
    - Locate the group, select it, and click **Assign Group** above the grid.

#### Connect your BeyondTrust Password Safe Account to Datadog

1. Add the application user's BeyondTrust Password Safe Client ID, Client Secret, and API Base Endpoint.

   | Parameters                        | Description                                                                          |
   | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | API Base Endpoint                 | API Base Endpoint used to make requests to the Password Safe public API (Example: `https://beyondtrustcloud.com/BeyondTrust/api/public/v3`).    |
   | Client ID                         | Client ID of the application user present in BeyondTrust Password Safe.              |
   | Client Secret                     | Client Secret of the application user present in BeyondTrust Password Safe.          |

2. Click **Save**.

## Data Collected

### Logs

The BeyondTrust Password Safe integration collects and forwards Passwords, Sessions, Managed Systems, Managed Accounts, Secrets Safe activities, and audit logs to Datadog.

### Metrics

BeyondTrust Password Safe integration does not include any metrics.

### Events

BeyondTrust Password Safe integration does not include any events.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission denied while port binding

If you see a **Permission denied** error while port binding in the Agent logs:

1. Binding to a port number under 1024 requires elevated permissions. Grant access to the port using the `setcap` command:

   ```shell
   sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+ep /opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/agent
   ```

2. Verify the setup is correct by running the `getcap` command:

   ```shell
   sudo getcap /opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/agent
   ```

   With the expected output:

   ```shell
   /opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/agent = cap_net_bind_service+ep
   ```

   **Note**: Re-run this `setcap` command every time you upgrade the Agent.

3. [Restart the Agent][6].

### Data is not being collected

Ensure firewall settings allow traffic through the configured port.

### Port already in use

On systems running Syslog, the Agent may fail to bind to port 514 and display the following error: 
   
    Can't start UDP forwarder on port 514: listen udp :514: bind: address already in use

This error occurs because Syslog uses port 514 by default. 

To resolve:
  - Disable Syslog, OR
  - Configure the Agent to listen on a different, available port.

### Error related to unidentified CIDR Range

If you encounter an error indicating that the request is originating from an unidentified CIDR range, it may be due to a change in Datadog's outbound IP ranges. To retrieve and update the allowed CIDR ranges, follow the steps in [Retrieve Datadog CIDR Range](#retrieve-datadog-cidr-range).

# Agent Check: system cores
{{< img src="integrations/systemcore/syscoredash.png" alt="System Core" responsive="true" popup="true">}}
## Overview

This check collects the number of CPU cores on a host and CPU times (i.e. system, user, idle, etc).

## Setup
### Installation

The system_core check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `system_core.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory. See the [sample system_core.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options:

    ```
    init_config:

    instances:
      - foo: bar
    ```

    The Agent just needs one item in `instances` in order to enable the check. The content of the item doesn't matter.

2. [Restart the Agent][3] to enable the check.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `system_core` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][5] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

Depending on the platform, the check may collect other CPU time metrics, e.g. `system.core.interrupt` on Windows, `system.core.iowait` on Linux, etc.

### Events
The System Core check does not include any events at this time.

### Service Checks
The System Core check does not include any service checks at this time.

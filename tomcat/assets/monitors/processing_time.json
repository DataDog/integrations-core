    "message": "There is an anomaly in the Tomcat average processing time on host: {{host.name}} \n\nIf the processing time increases as traffic increases, then you may not have enough worker threads to process the requests, or your server is reaching its threshold and consuming too much memory.\n\nNote: When compared with the `tomcat.request_count` metric, you can gauge how many requests your server can efficiently handle.",

on:
  # Triggering minimum base package tests can be useful outside of the schedule, for instance for PRs
  # that add new integrations or ones that bump the Pydantic dependency in the base package.
  # Until we figure out how best to trigger these automatically we're leaving the door open to easily
  # trigger this manually with the right branch.

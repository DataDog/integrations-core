# This workflow claims package names on PyPI for our integrations by publishing empty packages.
# The working packages can be found here:
# https://dd-integrations-core-wheels-build-stable.datadoghq.com/targets/simple/index.html
# This is a work-around until PyPI adds support for namespaces and we claim an entire namespace for Datadog.

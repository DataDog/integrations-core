          ## ⚠️ Action Pinning Validation Failed

          This check ensures actions are pinned to a specific commit SHA for security and reliability. This validation did not pass for your workflow.

          Here's how to resolve this:

          **1. If you added or modified an action:**
          * Ensure it's pinned to a full commit SHA (e.g., `actions/checkout@a12b34cdef567890...`), not a tag or branch.
          * For new actions or versions, please ping `@agent-integrations` in your pull request to validate and allow-list its usage.

          **2. If you have *not* changed any actions in this branch:**
          * An allowed action version may have been updated centrally, and your branch is now using an older, unpermitted version.
          * Update your branch with the latest changes from `master` (or your repository's main branch) to get the current allowed actions.

          If the issue persists after these steps, please contact `@agent-integrations` for assistance.

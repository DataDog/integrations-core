        Version 3 or 4 of PowerDNS Recursor to connect to.
        The PowerDNS Recursor in v4 has a production ready web server that allows for
        statistics gathering. In version 3.x the server was marked as experimental.

        As the server was marked as experimental in version 3 many of the metrics have
        changed names and the API structure (paths) have also changed. With these changes
        there has been a need to separate the two concerns. The check now has a key value
        version: which if set to version 4 queries with the correct API path on the
        non-experimental web server.

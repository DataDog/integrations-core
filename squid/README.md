# Squid Integration

## Overview

This integration lets you monitor your Squid metrics from the Cache Manager directly in Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

The Agent's Squid integration is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your Squid server.  

If you need the newest version of the Squid check, install the `dd-check-squid` package; this package's check overrides the one packaged with the Agent. See the [integrations-core](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core#installing-the-integrations) repository for more details.

## Configuration

Create a file `squid.yaml` in the Agent's `conf.d` directory. See the [sample squid.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/squid/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options:

```yaml
init_config:

instances:
  # A list of squid instances identified by their name

  - name: my_squid
  #   host: localhost  # The hostname or ip address of the squid server. Default to 'localhost'
  #   port: 3128  # The port where the squid server is listening. Default to 3128
  #   tags: ['custom:tag']  # A list of tags that you wish to send with your squid metrics
```

Restart the Agent to start sending metrics and service checks to Datadog.

## Validation

[Run the Agent's info subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/) and look for `squid` under the Checks section:

```
    Checks
    ======
        [...]

        squid
        -----
          - instance #0 [OK]
          - Collected 40 metrics, 0 events & 1 service checks

        [...]
```

## Compatibility

The squid check is compatible with all major platforms.

## Data Collected

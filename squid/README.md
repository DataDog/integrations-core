# Squid Integration

## Overview

This integration lets you monitor your Squid metrics from the Cache Manager directly in Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

The Agent's Squid check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Squid server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `squid.d/conf.yaml`, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2]. See the [sample squid.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options:

```
    init_config:

    instances:
        # A list of squid instances identified by their name

        - name: my_squid
        #   host: localhost  # The hostname or ip address of the squid server. Default to 'localhost'
        #   port: 3128  # The port where the squid server is listening. Default to 3128
        #   tags: ['custom:tag']  # A list of tags that you wish to send with your squid metrics
```

2. [Restart the Agent][4] to start sending metrics and service checks to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `squid` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6]

### Events

The Squid check does not include any events at this time

### Service Checks

**squid.can_connect**:
Returns CRITICAL if the Agent cannot connect to Squid to collect metrics, otherwise OK.

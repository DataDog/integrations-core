# Gitlab Runner Integration

## Overview

Integration that allows to:

- Visualize and monitor metrics collected via Gitlab Runners through Prometheus
- Validate that the Gitlab Runner can connect to Gitlab

See the [Gitlab Runner documentation][111] for
more information about Gitlab Runner and its integration with Prometheus

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][112] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The Gitlab Runner check is included in the [Datadog Agent][113] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Gitlab servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `gitlab_runner.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][114], to point to the Runner's Prometheus metrics endpoint and to the Gitlab master to have a service check. See the [sample gitlab_runner.d/conf.yaml][115] for all available configuration options.

**Note**: The `allowed_metrics` item in the `init_config` section allows to specify the metrics that should be extracted.

**Remarks**: Some metrics should be reported as `rate` (i.e., `ci_runner_errors`)

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][116] and look for `gitlab_runner` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][117] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Log collection


1. In your `gitlab_runner` [configuration file][119], change the log format to `json` (_Available for Gitlab Runner versions >=11.4.0_ ):
   ```toml
   log_format = "json"
   ```

2. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, you need to enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

3. Add the `dd-agent` user to the `systemd-journal` group by running:
   ```text
   usermod -a -G systemd-journal dd-agent
   ```

4. Add this configuration block to your `gitlab_runner.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your CouchDB Logs:

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: jounrald
       source: gitlab-runner
   ```

    See the [sample gitlab_runner.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

5. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Events

The Gitlab Runner check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

The Gitlab Runner check provides a service check to ensure that the Runner can talk to the Gitlab master and another one to ensure that the
local Prometheus endpoint is available.

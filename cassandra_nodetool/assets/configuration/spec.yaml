        description: |
          The command or path to nodetool (for example, /usr/bin/nodetool or docker exec container nodetool)
          can be overwritten on an instance.
          Note: Agent v6.11+ on Windows runs as an unprivileged user (`ddagentuser`). That user needs to be granted
          access to the nodetool installation directory for the check to work.
          The nodetool installation also sets some environment variables (for example, `CASSANDRA_HOME`
          and `DSCINSTALLDIR`), but sets them as variables only for the user doing the nodetool installation.
          You should set those environment variables as system-wide variables.

        Username from the credentials needed to connect to the host. These are the credentials for the JMX server.
        For the check to work, this user must have a read/write access so that the Datadog Cassandra Nodetool

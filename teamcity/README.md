# Agent Check: Teamcity

## Overview

This check watches for build-related events and sends them to Datadog.

Unlike most Agent checks, this one doesn't collect any metrics-just events.

## Setup
### Installation

The Teamcity check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Teamcity servers.

### Configuration
#### Prepare Teamcity

Follow [Teamcity's documentation][2] to enable Guest Login.

Edit the `teamcity.d/conf.yaml` in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][8]. See the [sample teamcity.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options:

```
init_config:

instances:
  - name: My Website
    server: teamcity.mycompany.com
#   server: user:password@teamcity.mycompany.com # if you set basic_http_authentication to true
#   basic_http_authentication: true # default is false
    build_configuration: MyWebsite_Deploy # the internal build ID of the build configuration you wish to track
#   host_affected: msicalweb6 # defaults to hostname of the Agent's host
#   is_deployment: true       # causes events to use the word 'deployment' in their messaging
#   ssl_validation: false     # default is true
#   tags:                     # add custom tags to events
#   - test
```

Add an item like the above to `instances` for each build configuration you want to track.

[Restart the Agent][4] to start collecting and sending Teamcity events to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][5] and look for `teamcity` under the Checks section.

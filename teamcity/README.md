# Agent Check: Teamcity

## Overview

This check watches for successful build-related events and sends them to Datadog.

Unlike most Agent checks, this one doesn't collect any metricsâ€”just events.

## Setup

### Installation

The Teamcity check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Teamcity servers.

### Configuration

#### Prepare Teamcity

Follow [Teamcity's documentation][3] to enable Guest Login.

#### Host

Follow the instructions below to configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Containerized](#containerized) section.

Edit the `teamcity.d/conf.yaml` in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][4]. See the [sample teamcity.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options:

```yaml
init_config:

instances:
  - name: My Website
    server: teamcity.mycompany.com

    # the internal build ID of the build configuration you wish to track
    build_configuration: MyWebsite_Deploy
```

Add an item like the above to `instances` for each build configuration you want to track.

[Restart the Agent][6] to start collecting and sending Teamcity events to Datadog.

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][1] for guidance on applying the parameters below.

| Parameter            | Value                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` | `teamcity`                                                                                        |
| `<INIT_CONFIG>`      | blank or `{}`                                                                                     |
| `<INSTANCE_CONFIG>`  | `{"name": "<BUILD_NAME>", "server":"%%host%%", "build_configuration":"<BUILD_CONFIGURATION_ID>"}` |

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][7] and look for `teamcity` under the Checks section.

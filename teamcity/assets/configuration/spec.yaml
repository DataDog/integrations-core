          Requires Python version 3.

          Enable in a separate instance to collect Prometheus metrics.
          This option does not collect events, service checks, or metrics from the TeamCity REST API.

          Mapping of TeamCity projects and build configurations to collect events and metrics from the TeamCity REST API.
          
          Configure only one of `projects` or `build_configuration` per instance.
          
          Requires Python version 3. For Python version 2, use the `build_configuration` option to configure 
          one build configuration ID per instance.

          Configure each Project ID or Project ID RegEx pattern as the top-level keys or nested under the optional
          `include` or `exclude` keys to filter your TeamCity projects more granularly.

          Each Project ID key value may be configured with a mapping of the optional `include` and `exclude` keys to
          specify Build Configuration ID RegEx match patterns. If `include` and `exclude` keys are omitted,
          all Build Configurations per specified Project are collected.
          In case of overlap, patterns specified with `exclude` take precedence.

          * To collect all build configurations per Project ID, configure an empty mapping value:

              projects:
                <PROJECT_ID>: {}
                <PROJECT_ID_REGEX>: {}

          OR

              projects:
                include:
                  - <PROJECT_ID_REGEX>: {}
                  - <PROJECT_ID_REGEX>: {}
                exclude:
                  - <PROJECT_ID_REGEX>: {}

          * To filter build configurations in each configured Project, use the optional `include` and `exclude` keys
            to configure a list of Build Configuration IDs or RegEx matching patterns:

              projects:
                include:
                  - <PROJECT_ID_REGEX>:
                      include:
                        - <BUILD_CONFIG_ID>
                        - <BUILD_CONFIG_ID_REGEX>
                      exclude:
                        - <BUILD_CONFIG_ID_REGEX>

          * Configure `<PROJECT_ID>.limit` to limit discovered build configurations for the given project.
            If `<PROJECT_ID>.limit` is omitted, the `default_build_configs_limit` is used.

              projects:
                include:
                  - <PROJECT_ID_REGEX>:
                      limit: 5
                      include:
                        - <BUILD_CONFIG_ID_REGEX>
                        - <BUILD_CONFIG_ID_REGEX>
                      exclude:
                        - <BUILD_CONFIG_ID_REGEX>

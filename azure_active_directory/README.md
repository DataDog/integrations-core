# Agent Check: azure_active_directory

## Overview

Azure Active Directory is a cloud hosted Active Directory offering by Microsoft Azure.
This integration allows you to ingest your [Azure AD activity logs][1] (audit and sign-in logs) to Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

This integration forwards logs to Datadog using Azure with Event Hubs. Configure Azure AD to forward activity logs to the event hub.

### Configuration

1. Set up the log forwarding pipeline from Azure to Datadog using Event Hubs by following the [log collection documentation][2].

2. In Azure portal, select _Azure Active Directory > Monitoring > Audit logs_.
   
3. Select **Export Settings**.

4. In the Diagnostics settings pane, do one of the following:

   - To change existing settings, select **Edit setting**.
   - To add new settings, select **Add diagnostics setting**. You can have up to three settings.

5. Select the **Stream to an event hub** check box, and then select **Event Hub/Configure**.

6. Select the Azure subscription and Event Hubs namespace that you created earlier to route the logs to.
   
7. Select OK to exit the event hub configuration.

8. Do one or both of the following. Datadog recommends selecting both.

   - To send audit logs, select the **AuditLogs** check box.
   - To send sign-in logs, select the **SignInLogs** check box.
  
9. Select **Save**.

Logs should start coming into Datadog within 15 minutes.
For more details on the setup, see the [Azure tutorial][3].

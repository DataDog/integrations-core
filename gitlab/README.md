# Gitlab Integration

## Overview

Integration that allows to:

* Visualize and monitor metrics collected via Gitlab through Prometheus

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/ for
more information about Gitlab and its integration with Prometheus

## Setup
### Installation

Install the `dd-check-gitlab` package manually or with your favorite configuration manager

### Configuration

Edit the `gitlab.yaml` file to point to the Gitlab's Prometheus metrics endpoint.
See the [sample gitlab.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/gitlab/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options.

The `allowed_metrics` item in the `init_config` section allows to specify the metrics that should be extracted.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/203764635-Agent-Status-and-Information) and look for `gitlab` under the Checks section:

    Checks

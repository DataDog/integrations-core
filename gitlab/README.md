# Gitlab Integration

## Overview

Integration that allows to:

* Visualize and monitor metrics collected via Gitlab through Prometheus

See the [Gitlab documentation][107] for more information about Gitlab and its integration with Prometheus

## Setup
### Installation

The Gitlab check is included in the [Datadog Agent][101] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Gitlab servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `gitlab.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory, to point to the Gitlab's Prometheus metrics endpoint.
See the [sample gitlab.d/conf.yaml][102] for all available configuration options.

**Note**: The `allowed_metrics` item in the `init_config` section allows to specify the metrics that should be extracted.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][103] and look for `gitlab` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics
See [metadata.csv][104] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events
The Gitlab check does not include any events at this time.

### Service Checks
The Gitlab check includes a readiness and a liveness service check.
Moreover, it provides a service check to ensure that the local Prometheus endpoint is available.

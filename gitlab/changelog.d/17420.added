Adds additional Geo metrics. *Note: Some metrics are only available depending on your Gitlab version: refer to the Metrics sub-section in Data Collected available in our [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/gitlab/) to see the minimum required version (indicated within brackets). For instance, `gitlab.geo.group.wiki.repositories` requires at least `13.10`.*

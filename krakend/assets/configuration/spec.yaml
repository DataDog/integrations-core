        Collect Go runtime metrics exposed by KrakenD's Prometheus endpoint.

        Set to `false` to prevent Datadog from collecting these metrics, even if
        KrakenD is configured to expose them (for example, for use with other monitoring tools).
        Defaults to `true`, meaning Datadog will collect these metrics if available.
        This setting in `init_config` provides a default for all instances; it can be overridden per instance.

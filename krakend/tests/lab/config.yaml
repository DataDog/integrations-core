# Krakend Traffic Generator Configuration
#
# This file contains the request probabilities for different endpoints.
# You can modify these values while the traffic generator is running,
# and the changes will be picked up automatically every 5 seconds.
#
# Probabilities should be between 0.0 and 1.0
# Higher values mean the endpoint will be called more frequently

request_probabilities:
  /api/valid: 0.75              # Successful requests

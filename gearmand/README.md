# Gearman Integration

## Overview

Collect Gearman metrics to:

- Visualize Gearman performance.
- Know how many tasks are queued or running.
- Correlate Gearman performance with the rest of your applications.

## Setup

### Installation

The Gearman check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Gearman job servers.

### Configuration

#### Host

Follow the instructions below to configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Containerized](#containerized) section.

1. Edit the `gearmand.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3] to start collecting your Gearman performance data. See the [sample gearmand.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

   ```yaml
   init_config:

   instances:
     - server: localhost
       port: 4730
   ```

2. [Restart the Agent][5]

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][1] for guidance on applying the parameters below.

| Parameter            | Value                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` | `gearmand`                             |
| `<INIT_CONFIG>`      | blank or `{}`                          |
| `<INSTANCE_CONFIG>`  | `{"server":"%%host%%", "port":"4730"}` |

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][6] and look for `gearmand` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][7] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The Gearmand check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

`gearman.can_connect`:

Returns `Critical` if the Agent cannot connect to Gearman to collect metrics.

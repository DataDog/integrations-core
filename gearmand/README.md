# Gearman Integration

## Overview

Collect Gearman metrics to:

* Visualize Gearman performance.
* Know how many tasks are queued or running.
* Correlate Gearman performance with the rest of your applications.

## Setup
### Installation

The Gearman check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Gearman job servers.

### Configuration


1. Edit the `gearmand.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Gearman performance data.
    See the [sample gearmand.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.
    ```yaml
    init_config:

    instances:
        - server: localhost
        port: 4730
    ```

2. [Restart the Agent][3]

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `gearmand` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][5] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events
The Gearmand check does not include any events at this time.

### Service Checks

`gearman.can_connect`:

Returns `Critical` if the Agent cannot connect to Gearman to collect metrics.

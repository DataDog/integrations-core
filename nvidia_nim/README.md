Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][3] for guidance on applying these instructions.

**Requirements**:
- This check requires Agent v7.61.0+
- This check uses [OpenMetrics][10] for metric collection, which requires Python 3.

`### Installation
The NVIDIA NIM check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package. No additional installation is needed on your server.

#### LLM Observability: Get end-to-end visibility into your LLM application's calls to NVIDIA Nim
NVIDIA NIM uses the OpenAI client to handle API calls from [NVIDIA NIM][11]. To monitor your application using NVIDIA NIM and set up LLM Observability, follow the instructions in the [OpenAI integration][12] documentation.
`
### Configuration

NVIDIA NIM provides Prometheus [metrics][1] indicating request statistics. By default, these metrics are available at http://localhost:8000/metrics. The Datadog Agent can collect the exposed metrics using this integration. Follow the instructions below to configure data collection from any or all of the components.

To start collecting your NVIDIA NIM performance data:
1. Edit the `nvidia_nim.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your NVIDIA NIM performance data. See the [sample nvidia_nim.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `nvidia_nim` under the Checks section.

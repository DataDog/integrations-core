# Disk Check

## Overview

Collect metrics related to disk usage and IO.

## Setup

### Installation

The disk check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your server.

### Configuration

The disk check is enabled by default, and the Agent collects metrics on all local partitions.
If you want to configure the check with custom options, Edit the `disk.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2]. See the [sample disk.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `disk` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][5] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The Disk check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

**`disk.read_write`**:
Returns `CRITICAL` if filesystem is in read-only mode.

# Disk Check

## Overview

Collect metrics related to disk usage and IO.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][1] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The disk check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your server.

### Configuration

The disk check is enabled by default, and the Agent collects metrics on all local partitions.
If you want to configure the check with custom options, Edit the `disk.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3]. See the [sample disk.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][5] and look for `disk` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

### Events
The Disk check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

Returns `CRITICAL` if filesystem is in read-only mode.

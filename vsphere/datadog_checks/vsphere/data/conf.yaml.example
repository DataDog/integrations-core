    ## @param empty_default_hostname - boolean - required
    ## The vSphere integration is a cluster-level check where metrics are usually unrelated to the host
    ## on which the Agent runs. Setting this parameter to true, prevents the Agent from attaching the hostname

    ## @param collection_level - integer - optional - default: 1

    ## 1: Only basic metrics - 4: every metric available.
    ## See https://code.vmware.com/apis/704/vsphere/vim.PerformanceManager.html for more details

    ## @param collection_type - string - optional - default: realtime
    ## Should be either 'realtime' or 'historical'
    ## Use 'realtime' to collect metrics that are about the past hour. Realtime metrics are about Hosts and VMs.
    ## Use 'historical' to collect metrics that are about longer time frames such as a day, week, or month.

    ## If you want both, we suggest creating an additional instance connecting to the same vCenter

    ## Each filter in the list is composed of three parameters.
    ## 'resource' is one of vm/host/datastore/datacenter/cluster on which to apply the filter
    ## 'patterns' is a list of matching regex, if any of those matches, the resource will be monitored.
    ## 'type' is either whitelist (default) or blacklist. If a resource is both whitelisted and blacklisted it will be
    ##        considered blacklisted.
    ## 'property' is the kind of property on which to apply the filter and must be one of those values:
    ##    - name (default) to filter on the resource name (defined by vCenter)
    ##    - inventory_path to filter on the full inventory path
    ##      (ex: \/<Datacenter_name>\/vm\/<FOLDER_NAME>\/.* for all vms in the folder <FOLDER_NAME>)
    ##    - tag to filter only the resources with a given tag.
    ##          The filter is applied on the value coming from vCenter. In this case, the value to match is the
    ##          one composed by <TAG_PREFIX><TAG_CATEGORY>:<TAG_VALUE> .
    ##          The filter also work for tags set by this vSphere integration: vsphere_host,
    ##          vsphere_datastore_cluster, vsphere_folder, vsphere_cluster, vsphere_compute,
    ##          vsphere_datacenter and vsphere_datastore.
    ##    - attribute to filter only the resources with a given attribute. Datadog has stricter rules (i.e no space),
    ##          but the filter is applied on the value coming from vCenter directly.
    ##          The value to match is the one composed by <ATTR_PREFIX><ATTR_KEY>:<ATTR_VALUE>
    ##    - hostname to filter on the ESXi Host name (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm')
    ##    - guest_hostname to filter on the VM hostname (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm' and
    ##      if VMware tools are installed)

    ## The vSphere integration collects tags for every ESXi host or VM in your environment.
    ## Those tags can be `vcenter_server`, vsphere_type`, `vsphere_host`, `vsphere_folder`, `vsphere_cluster`

    ## You will lose the ability to filter your hosts on the tags you specify but they will appear faster
    ## and will remove spikes from some `count by {TAG}` queries.

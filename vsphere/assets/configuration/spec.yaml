          Each filter in the list is composed of three parameters.
          'resource' is one of vm/host/datastore/datacenter/cluster on which to apply the filter
          'patterns' is a list of matching regex, if any of those matches, the resource will be monitored.
          'type' is either whitelist (default) or blacklist. If a resource is both whitelisted and blacklisted it will be
                 considered blacklisted.
          'property' is the kind of property on which to apply the filter and must be one of those values:
             - name (default) to filter on the resource name (defined by vCenter)
             - inventory_path to filter on the full inventory path
               (ex: \/<Datacenter_name>\/vm\/<FOLDER_NAME>\/.* for all vms in the folder <FOLDER_NAME>)
             - tag to filter only the resources with a given tag.
                   The filter is applied on the value coming from vCenter. In this case, the value to match is the
                   one composed by <TAG_PREFIX><TAG_CATEGORY>:<TAG_VALUE> .
                   The filter also work for tags set by this vSphere integration: vsphere_host,
                   vsphere_datastore_cluster, vsphere_folder, vsphere_cluster, vsphere_compute,
                   vsphere_datacenter and vsphere_datastore.
             - attribute to filter only the resources with a given attribute. Datadog has stricter rules (i.e no space),
                   but the filter is applied on the value coming from vCenter directly.
                   The value to match is the one composed by <ATTR_PREFIX><ATTR_KEY>:<ATTR_VALUE>
             - hostname to filter on the ESXi Host name (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm')
             - guest_hostname to filter on the VM hostname (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm' and
               if VMware tools are installed)
          Note1: 'datastore', 'datacenter' and 'cluster' filters are ignored when collecting realtime metrics as those
                  resources do not have realtime metrics

          `vsphere_compute`, `vsphere_datacenter`, `vsphere_datastore` and are attached to the vSphere metrics by default.
          By default those tags are submitted as host tags but you can submit them as metric tags if you need, see:

          and will remove spikes from some `count by {TAG}` queries.
          A good use case is to set this parameter to `[vsphere_host]`, indeed with VM migrations this tag is expected to
          change often and it is usually helpful to be informed quickly of this change.

          This value is used to determine the number of metrics the check will retrieve in the same API call.
          If too many API calls are made by the check, consider increasing this value
          If payloads are too large, consider decreasing this value
          A value <= 0 means unlimited: it makes one query for all the monitored objects
        value:
          type: integer
          display_default: 500
          example: 50
      - name: max_historical_metrics
        description: |
          This value is used to determine the number of historical metrics the check will retrieve in the same API call.
          Historical metrics collection is limited by the "config.vpxd.stats.maxQueryMetrics" configuration option
          on vCenter, any API call requesting more metrics than this value will be denied.
          By default, the check will retrieve the value of this parameter but you can override this behavior by specifying
          a value here.
        value:
          type: integer
          example: 256
      - name: batch_tags_collector_size
        description: |
          To fetch tags from your resources, queries are batched. If tags cannot be collected
          it might be that the batch size is too big.
        value:
          type: integer
          example: 200
      - name: batch_property_collector_size
        description: |
          This value is used to determine the maximum number of MORs returned by vCenter in the same API call,
          when exploring the infrastructure.
          If too many API calls are made by the check, consider increasing this value
          If payloads are too large, consider decreasing this value
          A value <= 0 means unlimited: it will query for the maximum number of objects at once
        value:
          type: integer
          example: 500
      - name: refresh_infrastructure_cache_interval
        description: |
          Number of seconds between each discovering and caching of your vSphere environment
          Consider increasing this value if your environment is large, as caching can take some time to complete.
        value:
          type: integer
          example: 300
      - name: refresh_metrics_metadata_cache_interval
        description: |
          Number of seconds between each refresh of the metrics metadata cache
        value:
          type: integer
          example: 1800
      - name: include_datastore_cluster_folder_tag
        description: |
          If a datastore is part of a datastore cluster, the tag "vsphere_datastore_cluster" indicating the datastore
          cluster name is sent along with datastore metrics.
          However, for compatibility reasons, this name is also sent as tag "vsphere_folder".
          You can disable this by setting this property to false.
          The default value is true.
        value:
          type: boolean
          example: true
      - name: rest_api_options

          REST API options
          The options are used when making vSphere REST API calls to retrieve vSphere tags
          when `collect_tags` instance config is enabled.
        options:
          - template: instances/http
      - name: connection_reset_timeout
        description: |
          The time interval in seconds at which the agent should re-authenticate using the provided credentials
        value:
          type: integer
          example: 900
      - template: instances/default
        overrides:
          empty_default_hostname.display_priority: 1
          empty_default_hostname.required: true
          empty_default_hostname.value.example: true
          empty_default_hostname.description: |
            The vSphere integration is a cluster-level check where metrics are usually unrelated to the host
            on which the Agent runs. Setting this parameter to true, prevents the Agent from attaching the hostname
            (and the host tags) to the metrics. It is especially important to leave this parameter to "true" when you are
            running the agent inside a vSphere VM as the VM tags are going to be unrelated to other metrics.

This measures the end-to-end latency of applying all commands in a Raft ready. Note that this closes over possibly multiple measurements of the 'raft.process.commandcommit.latency' metric, which receives datapoints for each sub-batch processed in the process."
raft_process_commandcommit_latency,cockroachdb.raft.process.commandcommit.latency.count,"Latency histogram for applying a batch of Raft commands to the state machine. This metric is misnamed: it measures the latency for *applying* a batch of committed Raft commands to a Replica state machine. This requires only non-durable I/O (except for replication configuration changes). Note that a ""batch"" in this context is really a sub-batch of the batch received for application during raft ready handling. The 'raft.process.applycommitted.latency' histogram is likely more suitable in most cases, as it measures the total latency across all sub-batches (i.e. the sum of commandcommit.latency for a complete batch)."
raft_process_handleready_latency,cockroachdb.raft.process.handleready.latency.count,"Latency histogram for handling a Raft ready. This measures the end-to-end-latency of the Raft state advancement loop, including: - snapshot application - SST ingestion - durably appending to the Raft log (i.e. includes fsync) - entry application (incl. replicated side effects, notably log truncation) These include work measured in 'raft.process.commandcommit.latency' and 'raft.process.applycommitted.latency'. However, matching percentiles of these metrics may be *higher* than handleready, since not every handleready cycle leads to an update of the others. For example, under tpcc-100 on a single node, the handleready count is approximately twice the logcommit count (and logcommit count tracks closely with applycommitted count). High percentile outliers can be caused by individual large Raft commands or storage layer blips. Lower percentile (e.g. 50th) increases are often driven by CPU exhaustion or storage layer slowdowns."
raft_process_logcommit_latency,cockroachdb.raft.process.logcommit.latency.count,"Latency histogram for committing Raft log entries to stable storage This measures the latency of durably committing a group of newly received Raft entries as well as the HardState entry to disk. This excludes any data processing, i.e. we measure purely the commit latency of the resulting Engine write. Homogeneous bands of p50-p99 latencies (in the presence of regular Raft traffic), make it likely that the storage layer is healthy. Spikes in the latency bands can either hint at the presence of large sets of Raft entries being received, or at performance issues at the storage layer."

raft_rcvd_stepped_bytes,cockroachdb.raft.rcvd.stepped_bytes.count,"Number of bytes in messages processed by Raft. Messages reflected here have been handed to Raft (via RawNode.Step). This does not imply that the messages are no longer held in memory or that IO has been performed. Raft delegates IO activity to Raft ready handling, which occurs asynchronously. Since handing messages to Raft serializes with Raft ready handling and size the size of an entry is dominated by the contained pebble WriteBatch, on average the rate at which this metric increases is a good proxy for the rate at which Raft ready handling consumes writes."

raft_replication_latency,cockroachdb.raft.replication.latency.count,"The duration elapsed between having evaluated a BatchRequest and it being reflected in the proposer's state machine (i.e. having applied fully). This encompasses time spent in the quota pool, in replication (including reproposals), and application, but notably *not* sequencing latency (i.e. contention and latch acquisition). No measurement is recorded for read-only commands as well as read-write commands which end up not writing (such as a DeleteRange on an empty span). Commands that result in 'above-replication' errors (i.e. txn retries, etc) are similarly excluded. Errors that arise while waiting for the in-flight replication result or result from application of the command are included. Note also that usually, clients are signalled at beginning of application, but the recorded measurement captures the entirety of log application. The duration is always measured on the proposer, even if the Raft leader and leaseholder are not colocated, or the request is proposed from a follower. Commands that use async consensus will still cause a measurement that reflects the actual replication latency, despite returning early to the client."

raft_storage_read_bytes,cockroachdb.raft.storage.read_bytes.count,"Counter of raftpb.Entry.Size() read from pebble for raft log entries. These are the bytes returned from the (raft.Storage).Entries method that were not returned via the raft entry cache. This metric plus the raft.entrycache.read_bytes metric represent the total bytes returned from the Entries method. Since pebble might serve these entries from the block cache, only a fraction of this throughput might manifest in disk metrics. Entries tracked in this metric incur an unmarshalling-related CPU and memory overhead that would not be incurred would the entries be served from the raft entry cache. The bytes returned here do not correspond 1:1 to bytes read from pebble. This metric measures the in-memory size of the raftpb.Entry, whereas we read its encoded representation from pebble. As there is no compression involved, these will generally be comparable. A common reason for elevated measurements on this metric is that a store is falling behind on raft log application. The raft entry cache generally tracks entries that were recently appended, so if log application falls behind the cache will already have moved on to newer entries."

requests_slow_distsender,cockroachdb.requests.slow.distsender,"Number of range-bound RPCs currently stuck or retrying for a long time. Note that this is not a good signal for KV health.

requests_slow_latch,cockroachdb.requests.slow.latch,"Number of requests that have been stuck for a long time acquiring latches. Latches moderate access to the KV keyspace for the purpose of evaluating and replicating commands. A slow latch acquisition attempt is often caused by another request holding and not releasing its latches in a timely manner.

This gauge registering a nonzero value usually indicates a serious problem and should be investigated."

An (evaluated) request has to pass through the replication layer, notably the quota pool and raft.

A nonzero value indicates range or replica unavailability, and should be investigated."

round_trip_latency,cockroachdb.round_trip.latency.count,"Distribution of round-trip latencies with other nodes. This only reflects successful heartbeats and measures gRPC overhead as well as possible head-of-line blocking. Elevated values in this metric may hint at network issues and/or saturation, but they are no proof of them. CPU overload can similarly elevate this metric. The operator should look towards OS-level metrics such as packet loss, retransmits, etc, to conclusively diagnose network issues. Heartbeats are not very frequent (~seconds), so they may not capture rare or short-lived degradations."

# Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes

## Overview

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) is a fully-managed Kubernetes service for deploying and running your containerized applications on Oracle Cloud. Datadog provides you with comprehensive visibility to your Kubernetes clusters managed by OKE. Once you have enabled your Datadog integration, you can view your Kubernetes infrastructure, monitor live processes, and track key metrics from all of your pods and containers in one place.

## Setup

Because Datadog already integrates with Kubernetes, it is ready-made to monitor OKE. If you're running the Agent in a Kubernetes cluster and plan to migrate to OKE, you can continue monitoring your cluster with Datadog.

Additionally, OKE node pools are supported.

# Btrfs Integration
{{< img src="integrations/btrfs/btrfs_metric.png" alt="btrfs metric" responsive="true" popup="true">}}
## Overview

Get metrics from btrfs service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor btrfs states
* Be notified about btrfs failovers and events.

## Setup
### Installation

The Btrfs check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on every server that uses at least one Btrfs filesystem.  

If you need the newest version of the Btrfs check, install the `dd-check-btrfs` package; this package's check overrides the one packaged with the Agent. See the [integrations-core](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core#installing-the-integrations) repository for more details.

### Configuration

1. Configure the Agent according to your needs, edit `conf.d/btrfs.yaml`. See the [sample btrfs.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/btrfs/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options.
2. [Restart the Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent)

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/) and look for `btrfs` under the Checks section:

```
  Checks
  ======
    [...]

    btrfs
    -------

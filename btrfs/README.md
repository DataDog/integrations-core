# Btrfs Integration

![BTRFS metric][8]

## Overview

Get metrics from Btrfs service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor Btrfs states
* Be notified about Btrfs failovers and events.

## Setup
### Installation

The Btrfs check is included in the [Datadog Agent][4] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers that use at least one Btrfs filesystem.

### Configuration

1. Configure the Agent according to your needs, edit the `btrfs.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory.
    See the [sample btrfs.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][3]

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `btrfs` under the Checks section.

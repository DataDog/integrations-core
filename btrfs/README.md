# Btrfs Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from btrfs service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor btrfs states
* Be notified about btrfs failovers and events.

## Setup
### Installation

The Btrfs check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on every server that uses at least one Btrfs filesystem.

### Configuration

### Validation

Run the Agent's `info` subcommand and look for `btrfs` under the Checks section:

```
  Checks
  ======
    [...]

    btrfs
    -------

```

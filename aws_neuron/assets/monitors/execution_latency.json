	"description": "This monitor tracks the execution latency, measuring the time taken for executions to complete. High execution latency can indicate performance bottlenecks, such as inefficient code, resource contention, or hardware limitations. Monitoring execution latency helps identify and address performance issues, ensuring smooth and responsive system operations.",

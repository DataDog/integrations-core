# The `result` field should be left blank to start. Once you submit your log asset files with
# your integration pull-request in a Datadog GitHub repository, Datadog's validations will
# run your raw logs against your pipeline and return the result. If the result output in the
# validation is accurate, take the output and add it to the `result` field in your test YAML file.

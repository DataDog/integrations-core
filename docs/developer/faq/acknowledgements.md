# Acknowledgements

-----

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the things we use, but rather a token of
appreciation for the services and open source software we publicly benefit from.

## Base

- The [Python programming language][python-home], the default language of Agent Integrations, enables us and
  contributors to think about problems abstractly and express intent as clearly and concisely as possible.

## Dependencies

We would be unable to move as fast as we do without the massive ecosystem of established software others have built.

If you've contributed to one of the following projects, thank you! Your code is deployed on many systems and devices across the world.

We stand on the shoulders of giants.

### Hosting

A huge thanks to everyone involved in maintaining [PyPI][]. We rely on it for providing all dependencies for
not only tests, but also all [Datadog Agent][] deployments.

## Documentation

- [MkDocs][mkdocs-home] provides us with powerful and extensible static site generation capabilities, leading to an
  equally impressive community around it.
- The [Material for MkDocs][docs-theme] theme allows us to create beautiful documentation with cross-browser and mobile support.
- [PyMdown Extensions][docs-extension-pymdown] gives us the ability to use advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality with
  simple, easy to use Markdown.

## CI/CD

- [Azure Pipelines][azp-home] is used for testing all Agent Integrations. A special shout-out to
  Microsoft for being [extremely generous][microsoft-generosity] with our allowance of parallel
  runners; only they were able to meet the requirements of our unique monorepo.
- [GitHub Actions][github-actions-home] is used for all repository automation, like documentation deployment and pull request labeling.

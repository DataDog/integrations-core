# Integration release

-----

Each Agent integration has its own release cycle. Many integrations are actively developed and released often while
some are rarely touched (usually indicating feature-completeness).

## Versioning

All releases adhere to [Semantic Versioning][semver-home].

Tags in the form `<INTEGRATION_NAME>-<VERSION>` [are added](../meta/cd.md) to the Git repository. Therefore, it's
possible to checkout and build the code for a certain version of a specific check.

## Setup

[Configure](../ddev/configuration.md#github) your GitHub auth.

## Identify changes

!!! note
    If you already know which integration you'd like to release, skip this section.

To see all checks that need to be released, run `ddev release show ready`.

1. Checkout and pull the most recent version of the `master` branch.

    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ```

    !!! danger "Important"
        Not using the latest version of `master` may cause errors in the [build pipeline](../meta/cd.md).

2. Review which PRs were merged in between the latest release and the `master` branch.

    ```
    ddev release show changes <INTEGRATION>
    ```

    You should ensure that PR titles and changelog labels are correct.

## Creating the release

1. Create a release branch from master (suggested naming format is `<USERNAME>/release-<INTEGRATION_NAME>`).
   This has the purpose of opening a PR so others can review the changelog.

    !!! danger "Important"
        It is critical the branch name is not in the form `<USERNAME>/<INTEGRATION_NAME>-<NEW_VERSION>` because one of
        our Gitlab jobs is triggered whenever a Git reference matches that pattern, see !3843 & !3980.

2. Make the release.

    ### Core

    ```
    ddev release make <INTEGRATION>
    ```

    You may need to touch your Yubikey multiple times.

    This will automatically:

    * update the version in `<INTEGRATION>/datadog_checks/<INTEGRATION>/__about__.py`
    * update the changelog
    * update the `requirements-agent-release.txt` file
    * update [in-toto metadata](../meta/cd.md)
    * commit the above changes

    ### Third party

    * Update the version on `datadog_checks/<INTEGRATION>/__about__.py`.
    
    * Update the CHANGELOG.md file This file can be automatically updated by `ddev` using the following command:
    
    ```
    ddev release changelog <INTEGRATION_NAME> <VERSION>
    ``` 

    This command will list all merged PRs since the last release and creates a changelog entry based on the pull request labels,
    this means that *the version bump needs to be on a separate PR from the one that included the changes*.
    For changelog types, we adhere to those defined by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/#how).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |


3. Push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request.

    1. Update the title of the PR to something like `[Release] Bumped <INTEGRATION> version to <VERSION>`.
    1. Ask for a review in Slack.

4. Merge the pull request after approval or wait for it to be merged.

## Metadata

You need to run certain backend jobs if any changes modified integration metadata or assets such as dashboards.
If you are a contributor a datadog employee will handle this.

## Bulk releases (core integrations only)

To create a release for every integration that has changed, use `all` as the integration name in the `ddev release make`
step above.

```
ddev release make all
```

You may also pass a comma-separated list of checks to skip using the `--exclude` option, e.g.:

```
ddev release make all --exclude datadog_checks_dev
```

!!! warning
    There is a known GitHub limitation where if an issue has too many labels (100), its state cannot be modified.
    If you cannot merge the pull request:

    1. Run the [remove-labels](../ddev/cli.md#ddev-meta-scripts-remove-labels) command
    1. After merging, manually add back the `changelog/no-changelog` label

## Betas (core integrations only)

Creating pre-releases follows the same workflow except you do not open a pull request but rather release directly from a branch.

In the `ddev release make` step set `--version` to `[major|minor|patch],[rc|alpha|beta]`.

For example, if the current version of an integration is `1.1.3`, the following command will bump it to `1.2.0-rc.1`:

```
ddev release make <INTEGRATION> --version minor,rc
```

After pushing the release commits to GitHub, run:

```
ddev release tag <INTEGRATION>
```

This manually triggers the [build pipeline](../meta/cd.md).

To increment the version, omit the first part, e.g.:

```
ddev release make <INTEGRATION> --version rc
```

## New integrations

### Core integrations

To bump a new core integration to `1.0.0` if it is not already there, run:

```
ddev release make <INTEGRATION> --new
```

To ensure this for all integrations, run:

```
ddev release make all --new
```

If a release was created, run:

```
ddev agent requirements
```

### Third party integrations

For first time releases of third party integrations, simply merge the integration to master and a release will be 
triggered with the specified version number in the about file.


## Base package releases

If you released `datadog_checks_base` or `datadog_checks_dev` then these must be uploaded to [PyPI][]
for use by [integrations-extras][].

This is automatically handled by two GitHub Action jobs: [release-base.yml][] and [release-dev.yml][].

In case you need to do it manually:

```
ddev release upload datadog_checks_[base|dev]
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors when signing with your Yubikey, ensure you ran `gpg --import <YOUR_KEY_ID>.gpg.pub`.
- If the [build pipeline](../meta/cd.md) failed, it is likely that you modified a file in the pull request
  without re-signing. To resolve this, you'll need to bootstrap metadata for every integration:

    1. Checkout and pull the most recent version of the `master` branch.

        ```
        git checkout master
        git pull
        ```

    1. Sign everything.

        ```
        ddev release make all --sign-only
        ```

        You may need to touch your Yubikey multiple times.

    1. Push your branch to GitHub.
    1. Manually trigger a build.

        ```
        git tag <USERNAME>bootstrap-1.0.0 -m <USERNAME>bootstrap-1.0.0
        ```

        The tag name is irrelevant, it just needs to look like an integration release. Gitlab doesn't sync
        deleted tags, so any subsequent manual trigger tags will need to increment the version number.

    1. Delete the branch and tag, locally and on GitHub.

## Releasers

For whom it may concern, the following is a list of GPG public key fingerprints known to correspond to developers
who, at the time of writing (27-09-2021), can trigger a build by signing [in-toto metadata](../meta/cd.md).

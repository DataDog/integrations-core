## Overview

This page walks through how Technology Partners can build an out-of-the-box integration using the Datadog Agent or Datadog API. 

The [Integrations page][3] includes integrations and custom dashboard widgets built by both Datadog and our Technology Partners, available at no cost to Datadog customers. 

The [Datadog Marketplace][4], on the other hand, is a commercial platform for Technology Partners to _sell_ a variety of offerings, including integrations, custom dashboard widgets, software licenses, and professional services to Datadog customers.

## Datadog Integrations

### [Agent-based Integration][2]
Agent-based integrations use the Datadog Agent to submit data via checks written by the partner. The implementation code for these integrations is hosted by Datadog. Agent Integrations are best suited for collecting data from systems or applications that live in a local area network (LAN) or virtual private cloud (VPC). Writing an Agent integration requires you to publish and deploy your solution as a Python wheel (.whl).

### [API-based Integration][1]
API-based integrations can enrich a customer's Datadog environment by submitting data from external technologies via the Datadog API. Customers authorize API integrations access to their accounts through OAuth, and partners write and host the implementation code that makes up the integration. API integrations work well for partners building a connector between Datadog and another SaaS platform.

## Why create an integration?

Adoption - Ensuring native support for Datadog reduces friction to adoption and incentivizes Datadog customers to build out their technology stack with partner technologies.

Added Visibility - Partners integrations appear on the Integrations page alongside all Datadog-built integrations, providing key visibility to all of Datadog's customers.

Out-of-the-box Metrics - Metrics reported from official Datadog integrations (unless the integration is sending in potentially unlimited metrics) are not counted as custom metrics, and therefore won't impact a customer's custom metric allocation.

### Responsibilities
Going forward, you, as the author of the integration, are the active maintainer of the integration. You are responsible for maintaining the code and ensuring the integrationâ€™s functionality. Datadog extends support on a best-effort basis for partner-built integrations, so please reach out to Datadog support if help is needed.

## Join the Datadog partner network

Before listing an offering on the Datadog Marketplace, you will first need to apply to the [Datadog Partner Network's][3] **Technology Partner** track. Once your application has been approved, you can begin to develop your offering.

## Request a sandbox account

All Technology Partners can request a dedicated sandbox Datadog account to aid in their development.

To request a sandbox account:

1. Log into the [Datadog Partner Portal][6].
2. On your personal homepage, click on the **Learn More** button under **Sandbox Access**.
3. Select **Request Sandbox Upgrade**.

<div class="alert alert-info">If you are already a member of a Datadog organization (including a trial org), you may need to switch to your newly created sandbox. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/org_switching/">Account Management documentation</a>.</div>

Creating a developer sandbox may take up to one or two business days. Once your sandbox is created, you can [invite new members from your organization][7] to collaborate with.

## Explore learning resources

Once you've joined the Technology Partner track and requested a sandbox account, you can start learning about developing offerings by:

* Completing the on-demand [**Introduction to Datadog Integrations**][8] course on the [Datadog Learning Center][9].
* Reading the documentation about setting up an [OAuth 2.0 client][11] for API-based integrations.


### Request access to Marketplace

To request access to the private Marketplace repository, email <a href="mailto:marketplace@datadoghq.com">marketplace@datadoghq.com</a>. Once you have been granted access, you can review an [example pull request][12] in the Marketplace repository with annotations and best practices.

## Getting Started
To get started with creating an offering, see [Create a Tile][13]. If you're interesting in building an Agent-based integration and selling it on the Datadog Marketplace, see [Create an Agent-based Integration][19].

## Coordinate GTM opportunities

Once a Marketplace tile is live, Technology Partners can meet with Datadog's Partner Marketing team to coordinate a joint go-to-market (GTM) strategy, which includes the following:
- A Datadog quote for partner press releases
- A blog post on the [Datadog Monitor][23]
- Amplification of social media posts

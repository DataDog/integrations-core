title: Create an API Integration
type: documentation
---

## Overview

Use a [Datadog API endpoint][1] to enrich and submit data from your backend, or pull data directly out of Datadog. API integrations work well in building a connector between Datadog and another SaaS platform. This method is ideal for Technology Partners that are SaaS based, and have an existing website for users to log into for authorization purposes.

API integrations send the following types of data to Datadog:

- [Metrics][2]
- [Logs & Log Pipelines][3]
- [Events][4]
- [Service Checks][5]
- [Traces][6]
- [Incidents][7]
- [Security Events][8]

This page provides instructions for creating an API integration in the `integrations-extras` repository. For more information about why you would want to create an API-based integration, see [Creating your own solution][9]. Since API integrations do not use the Datadog Agent to collect data, you need to create an informational tile-only listing once your development work is complete. 

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- You must have an [API key][10] and [application key][11].
- Determine which [Datadog site][12] you want to use.

An API key is required to submit data to a Datadog API endpoint. An application key is required to query data from Datadog or to create resources within the Datadog site. For more information, see [API and Application Key][13].

Create a connection to Datadog in your company's platform using the API key, application key, and site URL. 

### Create an OAuth client
Instead of requesting these credentials directly from a user, Datadog recommends using an [OAuth client][14] to handle authorization and access for API-based integrations. For more information, see [OAuth for Integrations][15] and [Authorization Endpoints][16]

You can explore examples of existing API integrations in the `integrations-extras` repository such as [Vantage][17].

## Set up a directory and fork the `integrations-extras` repository


1. Create a `dd` directory:

   {{< code-block lang="shell" >}}mkdir $HOME/dd{{< /code-block >}}
   
   The Datadog Development Toolkit expects you to be working in the `$HOME/dd/` directory. This is not mandatory, but working in a different directory requires additional configuration steps.

2. Clone the `integrations-extras` repository:

   {{< code-block lang="shell" >}}git clone git@github.com:DataDog/integrations-extras.git{{< /code-block >}}

## Install and configure the Datadog development toolkit

The Agent Integration Developer Tool allows you to create scaffolding when you are developing an integration by generating a skeleton of your integration tile's assets and metadata. For instructions on installing the tool, see [Install the Datadog Agent Integration Developer Tool][23].

After you install the Developer tool, configure it for the `integrations-extras` repo:

Set `integrations-extras` as the default working repository:

{{< code-block lang="shell" >}}
ddev config set extras $HOME/dd/integrations-extras
ddev config set repo extras
{{< /code-block >}}

If you used a directory other than `$HOME/dd` to clone the integrations-extras directory, use the following command to set your working repository:

{{< code-block lang="shell" >}}
ddev config set extras <PATH/TO/INTEGRATIONS_EXTRAS>
ddev config set repo extras
{{< /code-block >}}

## Populate the integration tile scaffolding

Run the `ddev` command to create scaffolding for an informational tile-only listing:

1. Make sure you're inside the `integrations-extras` directory:
   {{< code-block lang="shell" >}}cd $HOME/dd/integrations-extras{{< /code-block >}}
2. Run the `ddev` command with the `-t tile` option
   {{< code-block lang="shell" >}}ddev create -t tile "<Offering Name>"{{< /code-block >}}
   
The options you use with the `ddev` command are different depending on what type of integration you are developing. For a full list of the files created by the `ddev` command, see [Integrations assets][20].   

## Complete the necessary integration asset files

Make sure that the following required assets for your integration are complete:

{{% integration-assets %}}
   
### README

Once you have created a `README.md` file, add the following sections as H2s (`##`) and fill out the content that is displayed in the Integrations tile:

| Header Name | Header |
|-------------|--------|
| Overview | Write a description under an `## Overview` header that describes the value your offering provides to users and benefits to purchasing and installing the API integration (for example, out-of-the-box dashboards, logs, alerts, and more). <br><br>This information is displayed in the **Overview** tab on the integration tile. |
| Setup | Include all the steps to setting up your API integration that includes information divided into H3 headings (`###`). Standard topics include:<br><br>- Installing the integration using the in-app integration tile. <br>- Configuring the integration with the appropriate roles and permissions in your Datadog organization.|
| Uninstallation | Include all the steps to uninstalling your API integration. This information is displayed in the **Configure** tab on the integration tile.|
| Data Collected  | Specify the types of data collected by your API integration that includes information about out-of-the-box metrics, events, or service checks. <br><br>You can include additional types of data collected such as logs, monitors, dashboards, and more. If your API integration does not provide any of these, you do not need to add a Data Collected section. |
| Support | Provide contact information that includes an email to your Support team, a phone number to your company, a link to your company's documentation or blog post, and more help information in a bulleted list format. |

### Media Carousel

A media carousel of images and a video is included in your integration tile.

Technology Partners can add a video to an integration tile. Do not upload the video in your pull request. Instead, send a copy or a download link of your video to <a href="mailto:marketplace@datadoghq.com">marketplace@datadoghq.com</a>. The Marketplace team replies with a `vimeo_link` which you can add in the `manifest.json` file to include the video in the media carousel.

The video must meet the following requirements:

| Video Requirements | Description                                                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type               | MP4 H.264                                                                             |
| Size               | The maximum video size is 1GB.                                                        |
| Dimensions         | The aspect ratio must be 16:9 exactly and the resolution must be 1920x1080 or higher. |
| Name               | The video file name must be `partnerName-appName.mp4`.                                |
| Video Length       | The maximum video length is 60 seconds.                                               |
| Description        | The maximum number of characters allowed is 300.                                      |

Technology Partners can add up to eight images (seven if you are including a video) in an integration tile's media carousel.

The images must meet the following requirements:

| Image Requirements | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Follow this template to define the `media` object in the media carousel which includes an image, a video thumbnail, and a video:

{{< code-block lang="json" filename="manifest.json" collapsible="true" >}}
"media": [
      {
        "media_type": "image",
        "caption": "A Datadog API Integration OOTB Dashboard",
        "image_url": "images/integration_name_image_name.png"
      },
      {
        "media_type": "video",
        "caption": "A Datadog API Integration Overview Video",
        "image_url": "images/integration_name_video_thumbnail.png",
        "vimeo_id": 123456789
      },
    ],
{{< /code-block >}}

## Open a pull request

Open a pull request in the [`integrations-extras` repository][21] that adds images (such as logos and images) and asset files (such as `Changelog.md`, `README.md`, and `manifest.json`) to your API integration's tile-only listing in the [Integrations page][22]. Automatic tests run checks to verify that your pull request is in good shape and contains all the required content to be updated.

## Review process

Once your pull request passes all the checks, reviewers from the `Datadog/agent-integrations`, `Datadog/marketplace`, and `Datadog/documentation` teams provide suggestions and feedback on best practices.

Once you have addressed the feedback and re-requested reviews, these reviewers approve your pull request.

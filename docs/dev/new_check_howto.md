To consider an Agent-based Integration complete, and thus ready to be included in the core repository and bundled with the Agent package, a number of prerequisites must be met:

* A `README.md` file with the right format
* A battery of tests verifying metrics collection
* A set of images to be used in the UI tile
* A `metadata.csv` file listing all of the collected metrics
* A complete `manifest.json` file
* If the Integration collects Service Checks, the `service_checks.json` must be complete as well

These requirements are used during the code review process as a checklist. This documentation covers the requirements and implementation details for a brand new Integration.

## Prerequisites

Python 2.7 or 3.7 needs to be available on your system. Datadog recommends creating and activating a [Python virtual environment][1] to isolate the development environment. For more information, see the [Python Environment documentation][2].

You'll also need `docker` to run the full test suite.

## Setup

Clone the [integrations-extras repository][3]. By default, that tooling expects you to be working in the `$HOME/dd/` directory â€” this is optional and can be adjusted via configuration later.

```shell
mkdir $HOME/dd && cd $HOME/dd       # optional
git clone https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras.git
```

### Developer toolkit

The [developer toolkit][4] is comprehensive and includes a lot of functionality. Here's what you need to get started:

```
pip install "datadog-checks-dev[cli]"
```

If you chose to clone this repository to somewhere other than `$HOME/dd/`, you'll need to adjust the configuration file:

```
ddev config set extras "/path/to/integrations-extras"
```

If you intend to work primarily on `integrations-extras`, set it as the default working repository:

```
ddev config set repo extras
```

**Note**: If you do not do this step, you'll need to use `-e` for every invocation to ensure the context is `integrations-extras`:

```
ddev -e COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

## Scaffolding

One of the developer toolkit features is the `create` command, which creates the basic file and path structure (or "scaffolding") necessary for a new Integration.

### Dry-run

Let's try a dry-run using the `-n/--dry-run` flag, which won't write anything to disk.

```
ddev create -n awesome
```

This will display the path where the files would have been written, as well as the structure itself. For now, just make sure that the path in the *first line* of output matches your Extras repository.

### Interactive mode

The interactive mode is a wizard for creating new Integrations. By answering a handful of questions, the scaffolding will be set up and lightly pre-configured for you.

```
ddev create awesome
```

After answering the questions, the output will match that of the dry-run above, except in this case the scaffolding for your new Integration will actually exist!

## Write the check

### Intro

A Check is a Python class with the following requirements:

* It must derive from `AgentCheck`
* It must provide a method with this signature: `check(self, instance)`

Checks are organized in regular Python packages under the `datadog_checks` namespace, so your code should live under `awesome/datadog_checks/awesome`. The only requirement is that the name of the package has to be the same as the check name. There are no particular restrictions on the name of the Python modules within that package, nor on the name of the class implementing the check.

### Implement check logic

Let's say we want to create a Service Check named `awesome.search` that searches for a string on a web page. It will result in `OK` if the string is present, `WARNING` if the page is accessible but the string was not found, and `CRITICAL` if the page is inaccessible.

The code would look something like this:

```python
import requests

from datadog_checks.base import AgentCheck, ConfigurationError


class AwesomeCheck(AgentCheck):
    """AwesomeCheck derives from AgentCheck, and provides the required check method."""

    def check(self, instance):
        url = instance.get('url')
        search_string = instance.get('search_string')

        # It's a very good idea to do some basic sanity checking.
        # Try to be as specific as possible with the exceptions.
        if not url or not search_string:
            raise ConfigurationError('Configuration error, please fix awesome.yaml')

        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status()
        # Something went horribly wrong
        except Exception as e:
            # Ideally we'd use a more specific message...
            self.service_check('awesome.search', self.CRITICAL, message=str(e))
        # Page is accessible
        else:
            # search_string is present
            if search_string in response.text:
                self.service_check('awesome.search', self.OK)
            # search_string was not found
            else:
                self.service_check('awesome.search', self.WARNING)
```

To learn more about the base Python class, see the [Python API documentation][5].

### Writing tests

There are two basic types of tests: unit tests for specific functionality, and integration tests that execute the `check` method and verify proper metrics collection. Tests are _required_ if you want your integration to be included in `integrations-extras`. Note that [pytest][6] and [tox][7] are used to run the tests.

For more information, see the [Datadog Checks Dev documentation][8].

The first part of the `check` method retrieves and verifies two pieces of information we need from the configuration file. This is a good candidate for a unit test. Open the file at `awesome/tests/test_awesome.py` and replace the contents with something like this:

```python
import pytest

# Don't forget to import your Integration!
from datadog_checks.awesome import AwesomeCheck
from datadog_checks.base import ConfigurationError


@pytest.mark.unit
def test_config():
    instance = {}
    c = AwesomeCheck('awesome', {}, [instance])

    # empty instance
    with pytest.raises(ConfigurationError):
        c.check(instance)

    # only the url
    with pytest.raises(ConfigurationError):
        c.check({'url': 'http://foobar'})

    # only the search string
    with pytest.raises(ConfigurationError):
        c.check({'search_string': 'foo'})

    # this should not fail
    c.check({'url': 'http://foobar', 'search_string': 'foo'})
```

`pytest` has the concept of _markers_ that can be used to group tests into categories. Notice we've marked `test_config` as a `unit` test.

The scaffolding has already been set up to run all tests located in `awesome/tests`. Run the tests:

```
ddev test awesome
```

This test doesn't check our collection _logic_ though, so let's add an integration test. We use `docker` to spin up an Nginx container and let the check retrieve the welcome page. Create a compose file at `awesome/tests/docker-compose.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:stable-alpine
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
```

Now, open the file at `awesome/tests/conftest.py` and replace the contents with something like this:

```python
import os

import pytest

from datadog_checks.dev import docker_run, get_docker_hostname, get_here

URL = 'http://{}:8000'.format(get_docker_hostname())
SEARCH_STRING = 'Thank you for using nginx.'
INSTANCE = {'url': URL, 'search_string': SEARCH_STRING}


@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def dd_environment():
    compose_file = os.path.join(get_here(), 'docker-compose.yml')

    # This does 3 things:
    #
    # 1. Spins up the services defined in the compose file
    # 2. Waits for the url to be available before running the tests
    # 3. Tears down the services when the tests are finished
    with docker_run(compose_file, endpoints=[URL]):
        yield INSTANCE


@pytest.fixture
def instance():
    return INSTANCE.copy()
```

Finally, add an integration test to our `awesome/tests/test_awesome.py` file:

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.usefixtures('dd_environment')
def test_service_check(aggregator, instance):
    c = AwesomeCheck('awesome', {}, [instance])

    # the check should send OK
    c.check(instance)
    aggregator.assert_service_check('awesome.search', AwesomeCheck.OK)

    # the check should send WARNING
    instance['search_string'] = 'Apache'
    c.check(instance)
    aggregator.assert_service_check('awesome.search', AwesomeCheck.WARNING)
```

Run only integration tests for faster development using the `-m/--marker` option:

```
ddev test -m integration awesome
```

The check is almost done. Let's add the final touches by adding the integration configurations.

## Configuration

### Configuration file

#### Parameters

Parameters in a configuration file follow these rules:

* Placeholders should always follow this format: `<THIS_IS_A_PLACEHOLDER>` according to the documentation [contributing guidelines][9]:
* All required parameters are **not** commented by default.
* All optional parameters are commented by default.
* If a placeholders has a default value for an integration (like the status endpoint of an integration), it can be used instead of a generic placeholder.

#### Parameters documentation

Each parameter in a configuration file must have a special comment block with the following format:

```yaml
## @<COMMAND_1> <ARG_COMMAND_1>
## @<COMMAND_2> <ARG_COMMAND_2>
## <DESCRIPTION>
#
<YAML_PARAM>: <PLACEHOLDER>
```

This paragraph contains **commands** which are a special string in the form `@command`. A command is valid only when the comment line containing it starts with a double `#` char:

```yaml
## @command this is valid

# @command this is not valid and will be ignored
```

`<DESCRIPTION>` is the description of the parameter. It can span across multiple lines in a special comment block.

##### Available commands

###### Param

The `@param` command aims to describe the parameter for documentation purposes.

```
@param <name> - <type> - <required> - default:<defval>
```

Arguments:

* `name`: the name of the parameter, e.g. `apache_status_url`
* `type`: the data type for the parameter value. Possible values:
  * *integer*
  * *double*
  * *string*
  * comma separated list of <*integer*|*double*|*string*>
* `required`: whether the parameter is required or not. Possible values:
    * *required*
    * *optional*
* `defval`: default value for the parameter, can be empty.

For instance, here is the `@param` *command* for the Apache integration check `apache_status_url` parameter:

```yaml
init_config:

instances:

  ## @param apache_status_url - string - required
  ## Status url of your Apache server.
  #
  - apache_status_url: http://localhost/server-status?auto
```

### Populate the README

The `README.md` file provided by our scaffolding already has the correct format. You must fill out the document with the relevant information.

### Add images and logos

The directory structure for images and logos:

```
    awesome/
    â”œâ”€â”€ images
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ an_awesome_image.png
    â””â”€â”€ logos
        â”œâ”€â”€ avatars-bot.png
        â”œâ”€â”€ saas_logos-bot.png
        â””â”€â”€ saas_logos-small.png
```

The `images` folder contains all images that are used in the Integration tile. They must be referenced in the `## Overview` and/or `## Setup` sections in `README.md` as Markdown images using their public URLs. Because the `integrations-core` and `integrations-extras` repositories are public, a public URL can be obtained for any of these files via `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`:

```markdown
![snapshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/master/awesome/images/snapshot.png)
```

The `logos` folder must contain **three** images with filenames and sizes that match the following specifications _exactly_. Underneath each specification is a list of places where the images may appear in the web app.

#### saas_logos-bot.png (200â€†Ã—â€†128)

* Integration tile images at `/account/settings`
* Description heading at `/account/settings#integrations/{integration_name}`
* Integration monitor tiles and search bar results images at `/monitors#create/integration`

#### saas_logos-small.png (120â€†Ã—â€†60)

* Integration dashboards list images at `/dash/list`
* Some Integration dashboards/screenboards at `/dash/integration/{integration_dash_name}`

#### avatars-bot.png (128â€†Ã—â€†128)

* Event stream at `/event/stream`
* Notification icons at `/report/monitor`

### Metadata

Review the contents of `manifest.json` and `metadata.csv`. The metadata catalog is not currently automatically generated, so filling it out manually is a crucial part of the release process.

#### manifest.json

Find below the complete list of mandatory and optional attributes for your `manifest.json` file:

#### metadata.csv

Our example check doesn't send any metrics, so in this case we will leave it empty but find below the description for each column of your `metadata.csv` file:

#### service_checks.json

Our check sends a Service Check, so we need to add it to the `service_checks.json` file:

```json
[
    {
        "agent_version": "6.0.0",
        "integration":"awesome",
        "check": "awesome.search",
        "statuses": ["ok", "warning", "critical"],
        "groups": [],
        "name": "Awesome search!",
        "description": "Returns `CRITICAL` if the check can't access the page, `WARNING` if the search string was not found, or `OK` otherwise."
    }
]
```

Find below the description for each attributes-each one of them is mandatory-of your `service_checks.json` file:

| Attribute       | Description                                                                                                              |

| `agent_version` | Minimum Agent version supported.                                                                                         |
| `integration`   | Integration name.                                                                                                        |
| `check`         | Name of the Service Check. It must be unique.                                                                            |
| `statuses`      | List of different status of the check, to choose among `ok`, `warning`, and `critical`. `unknown` is also a possibility. |
| `groups`        | [Tags][14] sent with the Service Check.                                                                                  |
| `name`          | Displayed name of the Service Check. The displayed name must be unique and self-explanatory.                             |
| `description`   | Description of the Service Check                                                                                         |

### Building

`setup.py` provides the setuptools setup script that helps us package and build the wheel. To learn more about Python packaging, take a look at [the official python documentation][15]

Once your `setup.py` is ready, create a wheel:
- With the `ddev` tooling (recommended).
If working on an integration in integrations-extras or integrations-core,
`ddev release build <INTEGRATION_NAME>`, otherwise `ddev release build /path/to/package`

- Without the `ddev` tooling.
  ```
  cd {integration}
  python setup.py bdist_wheel
  ```

### Installing

To install your integration, you will need to build your python wheel first. See Building section above.
Then run the following command:
```
datadog-agent integration install -w /path/to/wheel.whl
```

The Base Check
--------------

The :ref:`datadog_checks_base` package provides a set of functionalities used by any Agent based Integration:

* :class:`~datadog_checks.base.checks.base.AgentCheck`, the base class that every Agent-based Integration is derived from.
* :ref:`Prometheus <prometheus>` and :ref:`OpenMetrics <openmetrics>` facilities.
* Boilerplate code implementing common operations.
* A testing framework that can be used independently of the Agent.

The Developer Toolkit
---------------------

The Developer Toolkit is designed for use by any Agent-based integration and provides two layers of support:

* The :ref:`api` package, providing a Python API for use during development and testing.
* A rich CLI, :ref:`ddev`, to run tests & E2E environments, manage dependencies, create new integrations and much more.

``datadog-checks-dev`` is distributed on PyPI as a universal wheel
and is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and supports Python 2.7/3.5+ and PyPy.

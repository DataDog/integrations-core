The Datadog Check Toolkit
-------------------------

The :ref:`datadog_checks_base` package provides a set of functionalities used by any Agent based Integration:

* :class:`~datadog_checks.base.checks.base.AgentCheck`, the base class that every Agent-based Integration is derived from.
* :ref:`Prometheus <prometheus>` and :ref:`OpenMetrics <openmetrics>` facilities.
* Boilerplate code implementing common operations.
* A testing framework that can be used independently of the Agent.

The :ref:`datadog_checks_dev` package provides tools for use during development and testing:

* A global ``pytest`` fixture exposing the test framework.
* Many utilities to assist with common tasks such as IO and environment setup/tear down.
* A rich CLI, :ref:`ddev`, to run tests & E2E environments, manage dependencies, create new integrations, etc.

  # The Spark check can retrieve metrics from Standalone Spark, YARN and
  # Mesos. All methods require the `spark_url` to be configured.
  #
  # For Spark Standalone, `spark_url` must be set to the Spark master's web
  # UI. This is "http://localhost:8080" by default.
  #
  # For YARN, `spark_url` must be set to YARN's resource manager address. The
  # ResourceManager host name can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file
  # under the `property yarn.resourcemanager.address` The ResourceManager port
  # can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file under the property
  # `yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address`. This is "http://localhost:8088"
  # by default.
  #
  # For Mesos, `spark_url` must be set to the Mesos master's web UI. This is
  # "http://<master_ip>:5050" by default, where `<master_ip>` is the IP
  # address or resolvable host name for the Mesos master.
  #
  # The use of `resourcemanager_uri` has been deprecated, but is still functional.

    # port(s) the Spark Web UI runs on and the check will filter out the frameworks
    # whose port don't match. If the check attempts to connect to a framework that
    # requires authentication it will fail; this is to prevent that.

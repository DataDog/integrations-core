          The Spark check can retrieve metrics from Standalone Spark, YARN and Mesos.

          For Spark Standalone, `spark_url` must be set to the Spark master's web UI.
          This is "http://localhost:8080" by default.

          For YARN, `spark_url` must be set to YARN's resource manager address. The
          ResourceManager host name can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file
          under the `property yarn.resourcemanager.address` The ResourceManager port
          can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file under the property
          `yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address`. This is "http://localhost:8088"
          by default.

          For Mesos, `spark_url` must be set to the Mesos master's web UI. This is
          "http://<master_ip>:5050" by default, where `<master_ip>` is the IP
          address or resolvable host name for the Mesos master.

          For Kubernetes or a standalone spark driver, `spark_url` must be set to the spark application driver IP.
          "http://<driver_ip>:4040" by default, where `<driver_ip>` is the IP
          address or resolvable spark driver service name.
        value:
          type: string
          example: http://localhost:8080
      - name: cluster_name
        required: true
        description: A friendly name for the cluster.
        value:
          type: string
      - name: spark_cluster_mode
        description: |
          To enable monitoring of a Standalone Spark cluster, the spark cluster
          mode must be set. Choose the cluster mode between :
           * `spark_yarn_mode`
           * `spark_standalone_mode`
           * `spark_mesos_mode`
           * `spark_driver_mode`
        value:
          type: string
          example: spark_yarn_mode
      - name: spark_ui_ports
        description: |
          If you're using multiple frameworks with Mesos, you can specify which
          port(s) the Spark Web UI runs on and the check filters out the frameworks
          whose port don't match. If the check attempts to connect to a framework that
          requires authentication it will fail; this is to prevent that.
        value:
          type: array
          items:
            type: integer
          example:
            - <PORT_1>
            - <PORT_2>
      - name: spark_pre_20_mode
        description: |
          To use an older (versions prior to 2.0) Standalone Spark cluster,
          the 'spark_pre_20_mode' must be set to true
        value:
          type: boolean
          example: false
      - name: spark_proxy_enabled

      - name: streaming_metrics
        description: |
          Enable collection of streaming statistics.
          Both Spark Streaming (DStream) and Structured Streaming (DataFrame) can be monitored but the latter requires
          additional configuration. To collect Structured Streaming metrics you need to:
            1. The default MetricsServlet sink has not been disabled.
            2. Set 'spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled=true' in the configuration.
          For more details refer to Spark official documentation:
            1. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics
            2. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#reporting-metrics-using-dropwizard  /noqa
          Note that if the MetricsServlet is not serving the JSON metrics payload on the default path (/metrics/json)
          you also need to set the `metricsservlet_path` option below.
        value:
          type: boolean
          example: true
      - name: metricsservlet_path
        description: |
          Some Spark metrics are only available via a DropWizard sink, notably the Structured Streaming ones. The
          integration fetches a JSON metrics payload from each application by leveraging the default MetricsServlet
          sink which exposes metrics on the /metrics/json path by default for all applications. If you configured
          the MetricsServlet to use a non-default path, you also need to update the following field to tell
          the integration about it.

          type: string

      - name: disable_legacy_cluster_tag
        description: Enable to stop submitting the tag `cluster_name`, which has been renamed to `spark_cluster`.
        value:
          type: boolean
          display_default: false
          example: true
        enabled: true
      - name: enable_query_name_tag
        description: |
          Enable to add a `query_name` tag for Structured Streaming metrics.
          This option should ONLY be enabled if the stream had a `.queryName` param supplied on `writeStream`,
          otherwise the stream is given a default UUID.

          auth_token.description: |
            This allows for the use of authentication information from dynamic sources.
            Both a reader and writer must be configured.

            The available readers are:

              - type: file
                path (required): The absolute path for the file to read from.
                pattern: A regular expression pattern with a single capture group used to find the
                         token rather than using the entire file, for example: Your secret is (.+)

                service_account (required): The DC/OS service account to authenticate.

                expiration: Token expiration in seconds, defaults to 300 (5 min).

            The available writers are:

              - type: header
                name (required): The name of the field, for example: Authorization
                value: The template value, for example `Bearer <TOKEN>`. The default is: <TOKEN>
                placeholder: The substring in `value` to replace by the token, defaults to: <TOKEN>

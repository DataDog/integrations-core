          The Spark check can retrieve metrics from Standalone Spark, YARN and Mesos.

          For Spark Standalone, `spark_url` must be set to the Spark master's web UI.
          This is "http://localhost:8080" by default.

          For YARN, `spark_url` must be set to YARN's resource manager address. The
          ResourceManager host name can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file
          under the `property yarn.resourcemanager.address` The ResourceManager port
          can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file under the property
          `yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address`. This is "http://localhost:8088"
          by default.

          For Mesos, `spark_url` must be set to the Mesos master's web UI. This is
          "http://<master_ip>:5050" by default, where `<master_ip>` is the IP
          address or resolvable host name for the Mesos master.

          For Kubernetes or a standalone spark driver, `spark_url` must be set to the spark application driver IP.
          "http://<driver_ip>:4040" by default, where `<driver_ip>` is the IP
          address or resolvable spark driver service name.
        value:
          type: string
          example: http://localhost:8080

      - name: spark_cluster_mode
        description: |
          To enable monitoring of a Standalone Spark cluster, the spark cluster
          mode must be set. Choose the cluster mode between :
           * `spark_yarn_mode`
           * `spark_standalone_mode`
           * `spark_mesos_mode`
           * `spark_driver_mode`

          type: string
          example: spark_yarn_mode
      - name: spark_ui_ports
        description: |
          If you're using multiple frameworks with Mesos, you can specify which
          port(s) the Spark Web UI runs on and the check filters out the frameworks
          whose port don't match. If the check attempts to connect to a framework that
          requires authentication it will fail; this is to prevent that.
        value:

          items:
            type: integer

            - <PORT_2>

        description: |
          To use an older (versions prior to 2.0) Standalone Spark cluster,
          the 'spark_pre_20_mode' must be set to true
        value:

          auth_token.description: |
            This allows for the use of authentication information from dynamic sources.
            Both a reader and writer must be configured.

            The available readers are:

              - type: file
                path (required): The absolute path for the file to read from.
                pattern: A regular expression pattern with a single capture group used to find the
                         token rather than using the entire file, for example: Your secret is (.+)

              - type: dcos_auth
                login_url (required): DC/OS login endpoint
                service_account (required): The DC/OS service account to authenticate.
                private_key_path (required): The absolute path for the DC/OS service account.
                expiration: Token expiration in seconds, defaults to 300 (5 min).

            The available writers are:

              - type: header
                name (required): The name of the field, for example: Authorization
                value: The template value, for example `Bearer <TOKEN>`. The default is: <TOKEN>
                placeholder: The substring in `value` to replace by the token, defaults to: <TOKEN>
      - template: instances/default
  - template: logs
    example:
    - type: file
      path: /var/log/spark/*.log
      source: spark
      service: <SERVICE_NAME>

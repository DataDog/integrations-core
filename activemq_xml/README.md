# ActiveMQ XML Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from ActiveMQ XML service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor ActiveMQ XML states
* Be notified about ActiveMQ XML failovers and events.

## Setup
### Installation

The ActiveMQ XML check is included in the [Datadog Agent][111] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

1. Edit `activemq_xml.d/conf.yaml`, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][112] with your stats `url`. See the [sample activemq_xml.d/conf.yaml][113] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][114].

#### Metrics collection
The ActiveMQ XML integration can potentially emit [custom metrics][115], which may impact your [billing][116]. By default, there is a limit of 350 metrics. If you require additional metrics, contact [Datadog support][117].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][118] and look for `activemq_xml` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

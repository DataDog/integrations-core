# Activemq_xml Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from activemq_xml service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor activemq_xml states
* Be notified about activemq_xml failovers and events.

## Setup
### Installation

The Activemq XML check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your servers.  

If you need the newest version of the ActiveMQ XML check, install the `dd-check-activemq_xml` package; this package's check overrides the one packaged with the Agent. See the [integrations-core](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core#installing-the-integrations) repository for more details.

### Configuration

Edit the `activemq_xml.yaml` file to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor. See the [sample activemq_xml.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/activemq_xml/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/) and look for `activemq_xml` under the Checks section:

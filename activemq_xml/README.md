# Activemq_xml Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from ActiveMQ XML service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor ActiveMQ XML states
* Be notified about ActiveMQ XML failovers and events.

## Setup
### Installation

The Activemq XML check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `activemq_xml.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's directory, to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor.  

    See the [sample activemq_xml.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][7]

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][3] and look for `activemq_xml` under the Checks section.

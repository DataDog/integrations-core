# ActiveMQ XML Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from ActiveMQ XML in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor ActiveMQ XML states.
- Be notified about ActiveMQ XML failovers and events.

## Setup

### Installation

The ActiveMQ XML check is included in the [Datadog Agent][111] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

Follow the instructions below to configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Containerized](#containerized) section.

#### Host

1. Edit `activemq_xml.d/conf.yaml`, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][112] with your stats `url`. See the [sample activemq_xml.d/conf.yaml][113] for all available configuration options.

   **Note**: The ActiveMQ XML integration can potentially emit [custom metrics][114], which may impact your [billing][115]. By default, there is a limit of 350 metrics. If you require additional metrics, contact [Datadog support][116].

2. [Restart the Agent][117].

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery with JMX][118] guide.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][119] and look for `activemq_xml` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][1110] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The ActiveMQ XML check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

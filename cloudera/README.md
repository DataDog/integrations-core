# Agent Check: Cloudera

## Overview

This integration monitors your [Cloudera Data Platform][1] through the Datadog Agent, allowing you to submit metrics and service checks on the health of your Cloudera Data Hub clusters, hosts, and roles.  

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][3] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The Cloudera check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package.
No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

#### Prepare Cloudera Manager
1. In Cloudera Data Platform, navigate to the Management Console and click on the **User Management** tab.
![User Management][10]

2. Click on **Actions**, then **Create Machine User** to create the machine user that queries the Cloudera Manager through the Datadog Agent.
![Create Machine User][11]

3. If the workload password hasn't been set, click on **Set Workload Password** after the user is created.
![Set Workload Password][12]

<!-- xxx tab "Host" xxx -->

#### Host
1. Edit the `cloudera.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Cloudera cluster and host data. See the [sample cloudera.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.  
**Note**: The `api_url` should contain the API version at the end.

   ```yaml
   init_config:

      ## @param workload_username - string - required
      ## The Workload username. This value can be found in the `User Management` tab of the Management 
      ## Console in the `Workload User Name`.
      #
      workload_username: <WORKLOAD_USERNAME>

      ## @param workload_password - string - required
      ## The Workload password. This value can be found in the `User Management` tab of the Management 
      ## Console in the `Workload Password`.
      #
      workload_password: <WORKLOAD_PASSWORD>

   ## Every instance is scheduled independently of the others.
   #
   instances:

      ## @param api_url - string - required
      ## The URL endpoint for the Cloudera Manager API. This can be found under the Endpoints tab for 
      ## your Data Hub to monitor. 
      ##
      ## Note: The version of the Cloudera Manager API needs to be appended at the end of the URL. 
      ## For example, using v48 of the API for Data Hub `cluster_1` should result with a URL similar 
      ## to the following:
      ## `https://cluster1.cloudera.site/cluster_1/cdp-proxy-api/cm-api/v48`
      #
      - api_url: <API_URL>
   ```

2. [Restart the Agent][5] to start collecting and sending Cloudera Data Hub cluster data to Datadog.

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][3] for guidance on applying the parameters below.

| Parameter            | Value                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` | `cloudera`                                                                                                       |
| `<INIT_CONFIG>`      | `{"workload_username": "<WORKLOAD_USERNAME>", 'workload_password": "<WORKLOAD_PASSWORD>"}`                       |
| `<INSTANCE_CONFIG>`  | `{"api_url": <API_URL>"}`                                                                                        |

#### Clusters Discovery

You can configure how your clusters are discovered with the `clusters` configuration option with the following parameters:

- `limit`
: Maximum number of items to be autodiscovered.  
**Default value**: `None` (all clusters will be processed)

- `include`
: Mapping of regular expression keys and component config values to autodiscover.  
**Default value**: empty map

- `exclude`
: List of regular expressions with the patterns of components to exclude from autodiscovery.  
**Default value**: empty list

- `interval`
: Validity time in seconds of the last list of clusters obtained through the endpoint.  
**Default value**: `None` (no cache used)

**Examples**:

Process a maximum of `5` clusters with names that start with `my_cluster`:

```yaml
clusters:
  limit: 5
  include:
    - 'my_cluster.*'
```

Process a maximum of `20` clusters and exclude those with names that start with `tmp_`:

```yaml
clusters:
  limit: 20
  include:
    - '.*'
  exclude:
    - 'tmp_.*'
```

#### Custom Queries

You can configure the Cloudera integration to collect custom metrics that are not be collected by default by running custom timeseries queries. These queries use [the tsquery language][14] to retrieve data from Cloudera Manager. 

**Example**:

Collect JVM garbage collection rate and JVM free memory with `cloudera_jvm` as a custom tag:

```yaml
custom_queries:
- query: select last(jvm_gc_rate) as jvm_gc_rate, last(jvm_free_memory) as jvm_free_memory
  tags: cloudera_jvm
```

Note: These queries can take advantage of metric expressions, resulting in queries such as `total_cpu_user + total_cpu_system`, `1000 * jvm_gc_time_ms / jvm_gc_count`, and `max(total_cpu_user)`. When using metric expressions, make sure to also include aliases for the metrics, otherwise the metric names may be incorrectly formatted. For example, `SELECT last(jvm_gc_count)` results in the metric `cloudera.<CATEGORY>.last_jvm_gc_count`. You can append an alias like in the following example: `SELECT last(jvm_gc_count) as jvm_gc_count` to generate the metric `cloudera.<CATEGORY>.jvm_gc_count`.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `cloudera` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][7] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The Cloudera integration collects events that are emitted from the `/events` endpoint from the Cloudera Manager API. The event levels are mapped as the following:

| Cloudera                  | Datadog                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `UNKNOWN`                 | `error`                        |
| `INFORMATIONAL`           | `info`                         |
| `IMPORTANT`               | `info`                         |
| `CRITICAL`                | `error`                        |

### Service Checks

See [service_checks.json][8] for a list of service checks provided by this integration.

## Troubleshooting

### Collecting metrics of Datadog integrations on Cloudera hosts
To install the Datadog Agent on a Cloudera host, make sure that the security group associated with the host allows SSH access. 
Then, you need to use the [root user `cloudbreak`][13] when accessing the host with the SSH key generated during the environment creation:

```
sudo ssh -i "/path/to/key.pem" cloudbreak@<HOST_IP_ADDRESS>
```

The workload username and password can be used to access Cloudera hosts through SSH, although only the `cloudbreak` user can install the Datadog Agent. 
Trying to use any user that is not `cloudbreak` may result in the following error:
```
<NON_CLOUDBREAK_USER> is not allowed to run sudo on <CLOUDERA_HOSTNAME>.  This incident will be reported.
```

### Config errors when collecting Datadog metrics
If you see something similar to the following in the Agent status when collecting metrics from your Cloudera host:

```
  Config Errors
  ==============
    zk
    --
      open /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/zk.d/conf.yaml: permission denied
```

You need to change the ownership of the `conf.yaml` to `dd-agent`:

```
[cloudbreak@<CLOUDERA_HOSTNAME> ~]$ sudo chown -R dd-agent:dd-agent /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/zk.d/conf.yaml
```

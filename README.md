This repository contains the Agent Integrations that Datadog officially develops and supports.
To add a new integration, please see the [Integrations Extras][5] repository and the
[accompanying documentation][6].

The [Datadog Agent][7] packages are equipped with all the Integrations from this
repository, so to get started using them, you can simply [install the Agent][8]
for your operating system. The [AGENT_CHANGELOG](AGENT_CHANGELOG.md) file shows
which Integrations have been updated in each Agent version.

## Contributing

Working with integrations is easy, the main page of the [development docs][6]
contains all the info you need to get your dev environment up and running in minutes
to run, test and build a Check. More advanced documentation can be found [here][20].

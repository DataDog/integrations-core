# Kong Integration

## Overview

The Agent's Kong check tracks total requests, response codes, client connections, and more.

## Setup
### Installation

The Kong check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Kong servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `kong.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2].

#### Metric collection

Add this configuration block to your `kong.d/conf.yaml` file to start gathering your [Kong Metrics](#metrics):

    ```yaml
    init_config:

    instances:
        # Each instance needs a `kong_status_url`. Tags are optional.
        -   kong_status_url: http://example.com:8001/status/
            tags:
            - instance:foo
        #-   kong_status_url: http://example2.com:8001/status/
        #    tags:
        #    - instance:bar
    ```

See the [sample kong.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][4] to begin sending Kong metrics to Datadog.

#### Log Collection

**Available for Agent >6.0**

Kong access logs are generated by NGINX, so the default location is the same as for NGINX files.

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. Enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    logs_enabled: true
    ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `kong.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Kong Logs:

  ```yaml
  logs:
     - type: file
       path: /var/log/nginx/access.log
       service: <SERVICE>
       source: kong

     - type: file
       path: /var/log/nginx/error.log
       service: <SERVICE>
       source: kong
  ``` 
  
Change the `path` and `service` parameter values and configure them for your environment.
See the [sample kong.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.


3. [Restart the Agent][3].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][5] and look for `kong` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events
The Kong check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

`kong.can_connect`:

Returns CRITICAL if the Agent cannot connect to Kong to collect metrics, otherwise OK.

## Overview

[Box][1] is a cloud-based file storage and collaboration platform that allows users to securely share, manage, and access files from anywhere.

This integration ingests **Enterprise Events** detailed logs, which includes user actions, admin activities, and Shield events from a Box enterprise instance.

**Note**: [Box Shield][6] must be enabled on your Box Enterprise account to access security insights and threat detection data.

This integration gathers enterprise events and forwards them to Datadog for seamless analysis.

With preconfigured dashboards, the integration offers clear visibility into activities within the Box platform. Additionally, it includes ready-to-use Cloud SIEM detection rules for enhanced monitoring and security.

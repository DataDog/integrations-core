            If true, the check will use the guest hostname for VMs instead of the VM name.
            This requires the VM to have VMware tools installed. If the guest hostname is
            not available, it will fallback to the VM name.
            Use this if you install the agent on VMs to avoid duplicate entries for hosts
            in the web application UI.
            Note: If VMs are duplicated in the Infrastructure List, follow these troubleshooting steps

            If true, the check will use the configured `host` parameter for ESXi hostnames instead of the Host name.
            You may need to use this if you install both the vSphere check and ESXi check to avoid duplicate entries
            for hosts in the web application UI.

            Some ESXi metrics can be tagged with instance values.
            For each resource type (vm, host) to collect,
            you can choose which metrics you want to collect the instance value as tags using a list of regex.

            Each filter in the list is composed of three parameters.
            'resource' is one of vm/host on which to apply the filter
            'patterns' is a list of matching regex, if any of those matches, the resource will be monitored.
            'type' is either include list (default) or exclude list. If a resource is both included and excluded it will be
                  considered excluded.
            'property' is the kind of property on which to apply the filter and must be one of those values:
              - name (default) to filter on the resource name (defined by vCenter)
              - hostname to filter on the ESXi Host name (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm')

            you can choose which metric you want to collect using a list of regex.
            If you do not specify a regex for the resource, all metrics will be collected.

            Use this option to send a subset of host tags as metric tags.
            The ESXi integration collects tags for every ESXi host or VM in your environment.
            Those tags can be `esxi_url`, esxi_type`, `esxi_host`, and `esxi_datastore`
            and are attached to the ESXi metrics by default.
            By default these tags are submitted as host tags, but you can submit them as metric tags instead by using
            this configuration option, see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging/using_tags/
            You will lose the ability to filter your hosts on the tags you specify but they will appear faster
            and will remove spikes from some `count by {TAG}` queries.
            A good use case is to set this parameter to `[esxi_host]`, indeed with VM migrations this tag is expected to
            change often and it is usually helpful to be informed quickly of this change.

              The ESXi integration is a check where metrics are usually unrelated to the host
              on which the Agent runs. Setting this parameter to true, prevents the Agent from attaching the hostname
              (and the host tags) to the metrics. It is especially important to leave this parameter to "true" when you are
              running the agent inside a vSphere VM as the VM tags are going to be unrelated to other metrics.

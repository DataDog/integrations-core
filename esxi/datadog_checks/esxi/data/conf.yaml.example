## All options defined here are available to all instances.
#
init_config:

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Additionally, this sets the default `service` for every log source.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

## Every instance is scheduled independently of the others.
#
instances:

    ## @param host - string - required
    ## The host used to resolve the ESXi IP. It is either a FQDN or an IP.
    #
  - host: <HOSTNAME>

    ## @param username - string - required
    ## The ESXi host username
    #
    username: <USERNAME>

    ## @param password - string - required
    ## The ESXi host password
    #
    password: <PASSWORD>

    ## @param use_guest_hostname - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## If true, the check will use the guest hostname for VMs instead of the VM name.
    ## This requires the VM to have VMware tools installed. If the guest hostname is
    ## not available, it will fallback to the VM name.
    ## Use this if you install the agent on VMs to avoid duplicate entries for hosts
    ## in the web application UI.
    ## Note: If VMs are duplicated in the Infrastructure List, follow these troubleshooting steps
    ##       https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/faq/troubleshooting-duplicated-hosts-with-vsphere/.
    #
    # use_guest_hostname: false

    ## @param collect_per_instance_filters - mapping - optional
    ## Use this option to collect metrics tagged with instance values.
    ## Some ESXi metrics can be tagged with instance values.
    ## For each resource type (vm, host) to collect,
    ## you can choose which metrics you want to collect the instance value as tags using a list of regex.
    ## See https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/esxi/datadog_checks/esxi/metrics.py
    ## for the list of collected metrics (do not prefix them with `esxi`)
    ## /!\ Use with parsimony, collecting per-instance metrics might be very expensive for big environments.
    #
    # collect_per_instance_filters:
    #   vm:
    #   - <VM_REGEX>
    #   host:
    #   - <HOST_REGEX>

    ## @param resource_filters - list of mappings - optional
    ## Each filter in the list is composed of three parameters.
    ## 'resource' is one of vm/host on which to apply the filter
    ## 'patterns' is a list of matching regex, if any of those matches, the resource will be monitored.
    ## 'type' is either include list (default) or exclude list. If a resource is both included and excluded it will be
    ##       considered excluded.
    ## 'property' is the kind of property on which to apply the filter and must be one of those values:
    ##   - name (default) to filter on the resource name (defined by vCenter)
    ##   - hostname to filter on the ESXi Host name (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm')
    ##   - guest_hostname to filter on the VM hostname (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm' and
    ##     if VMware tools are installed)
    #
    # resource_filters:
    #   - resource: vm
    #     property: name
    #     type: include
    #     patterns:
    #     - <VM_REGEX_1>
    #     - <VM_REGEX_2>
    #   - resource: vm
    #     type: exclude
    #     property: hostname
    #     patterns:
    #     - <HOSTNAME_REGEX>
    #   - resource: vm
    #     type: exclude
    #     property: guest_hostname
    #     patterns:
    #     - <GUEST_HOSTNAME_REGEX>

    ## @param metric_filters - mapping - optional
    ## Use this option to control what metrics to submit for each resource type
    ## For each resource type (vm, host) collected,
    ## you can choose which metric you want to collect using a list of regex.
    ## If you do not specify a regex for the resource, all metrics will be collected.
    ## See https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/esxi/datadog_checks/esxi/metrics.py
    ## for the list of collected metrics (do not prefix them with `esxi`)
    #
    # metric_filters:
    #   vm:
    #   - <VM_REGEX>
    #   host:
    #   - <HOST_REGEX>

    ## @param excluded_host_tags - list of strings - optional - default: []
    ## Use this option to send a subset of host tags as metric tags.
    ## The ESXi integration collects tags for every ESXi host or VM in your environment.
    ## Those tags can be `esxi_url`, esxi_type`, `esxi_host`, `esxi_folder`, `esxi_cluster`
    ## `esxi_compute`, `esxi_datacenter`, `esxi_datastore` and are attached to the ESXi metrics by default.
    ## By default these tags are submitted as host tags, but you can submit them as metric tags instead by using
    ## this configuration option, see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging/using_tags/
    ## You will lose the ability to filter your hosts on the tags you specify but they will appear faster
    ## and will remove spikes from some `count by {TAG}` queries.
    ## A good use case is to set this parameter to `[esxi_host]`, indeed with VM migrations this tag is expected to
    ## change often and it is usually helpful to be informed quickly of this change.
    #
    # excluded_host_tags:
    #   - <HOST_TAG>

    ## @param ssl_verify - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Set to false to disable SSL verification when connecting to the ESXi host
    #
    # ssl_verify: true

    ## @param ssl_cafile - string - optional
    ## Set to the absolute file path of CA certificates in PEM format
    #
    # ssl_cafile: <FILE_PATH>

    ## @param ssl_capath - string - optional
    ## Set to the absolute file path of a directory containing CA certificates
    ## in PEM format
    #
    # ssl_capath: <DIRECTORY_PATH>

    ## @param tags - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of tags to attach to every metric and service check emitted by this instance.
    ##
    ## Learn more about tagging at https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging
    #
    # tags:
    #   - <KEY_1>:<VALUE_1>
    #   - <KEY_2>:<VALUE_2>

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Overrides any `service` defined in the `init_config` section.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

    ## @param min_collection_interval - number - optional - default: 15
    ## This changes the collection interval of the check. For more information, see:
    ## https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/write_agent_check/#collection-interval
    #
    # min_collection_interval: 15

    ## @param empty_default_hostname - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## This forces the check to send metrics with no hostname.
    ##
    ## This is useful for cluster-level checks.
    #
    # empty_default_hostname: false

    ## @param metric_patterns - mapping - optional
    ## A mapping of metrics to include or exclude, with each entry being a regular expression.
    ##
    ## Metrics defined in `exclude` will take precedence in case of overlap.
    #
    # metric_patterns:
    #   include:
    #   - <INCLUDE_REGEX>
    #   exclude:
    #   - <EXCLUDE_REGEX>

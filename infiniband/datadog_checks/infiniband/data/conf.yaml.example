instances:

  -
    ## @param infiniband_path - string - optional - default: /sys/class/infiniband
    ## The path to the infiniband directory.
    #

    ## @param exclude_devices - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of devices to exclude from the check. Devices are located in the infiniband directory.

    ## @param additional_counters - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of additional counters to collect. The counter names are the files in which the counter 
    ## values are stored. These are located inside /sys/class/infiniband/devices/<device>/ports/<port>/counters.
    #
    # additional_counters:
    #   - additional_counter
    #   - rx_mpwqe_frag

    ## @param additional_hw_counters - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of additional hardware counters to collect. The counter names are the files in which the 
    ## counter values are stored. These are located inside 
    ## /sys/class/infiniband/devices/<device>/ports/<port>/hw_counters.
    #
    # additional_hw_counters:
    #   - additional_hw_counter
    #   - rx_mpwqe_frag

    ## @param exclude_counters - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of counters to exclude from the check.
    #
    # exclude_counters:
    #   - duplicate_request
    #   - lifespan

    ## @param exclude_hw_counters - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of hardware counters to exclude from the check.
    #
    # exclude_hw_counters:
    #   - VL15_dropped
    #   - link_downed

    ## @param tags - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of tags to attach to every metric and service check emitted by this instance.
    ##
    ## Learn more about tagging at https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging
    #
    # tags:
    #   - <KEY_1>:<VALUE_1>
    #   - <KEY_2>:<VALUE_2>

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Overrides any `service` defined in the `init_config` section.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

    ## @param min_collection_interval - number - optional - default: 15
    ## This changes the collection interval of the check. For more information, see:
    ## https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/write_agent_check/#collection-interval
    #
    # min_collection_interval: 15

    ## @param empty_default_hostname - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## This forces the check to send metrics with no hostname.
    ##
    ## This is useful for cluster-level checks.
    #
    # empty_default_hostname: false

    ## @param metric_patterns - mapping - optional
    ## A mapping of metrics to include or exclude, with each entry being a regular expression.
    ##
    ## Metrics defined in `exclude` will take precedence in case of overlap.
    #
    # metric_patterns:
    #   include:
    #   - <INCLUDE_REGEX>

# CHANGELOG - iis

2.0.0 / Unreleased
==================

**Breaking change notice**

Starting from this release, when no `sites` are specified for a given host in the check configuration,
the check collects data from all the IIS sites of that host and tags the metrics with a `site:` tag. Also, in this case, the aggregate
over all websites is tagged with `site:Total`.

In previous versions, when no `sites` were specified, the check collected only the aggregate metrics and did not tag these metrics with
a `site:` tag.

Please update your dashboards and monitors accordingly.

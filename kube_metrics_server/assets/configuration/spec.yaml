        prometheus_url.description: |
          The URL where your application metrics are exposed by Prometheus.
          It could be either the address of the metrics server service or
          the address of the pod itself.
          **Note**: Monitoring an exposed service of the metrics server
          that is backed by more than one pod could lead to inaccurate metrics
          because of load balancing. In this case, it is recommended to
          enable endpoint checks alongside the service check and use Autodiscovery
          to get the pod IP by setting `prometheus_url` to https://%%host%%:443/metrics
    - name: health_url

        URL for the kube-metrics-server health endpoint.

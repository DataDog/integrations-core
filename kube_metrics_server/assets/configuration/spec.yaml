        prometheus_url.description: |
          The URL where your application metrics are exposed by Prometheus.
          It could be either the address of the metrics server service or
          the address of the pod itself.
          Please note that monitoring an exposed service of the metrics server
          that is backed by more than one pod could lead to inaccurate metrics
          because of to the load balancing. In this case, it is recommended to
          enable endpoint checks alongside the service check and use autodiscovery
          to get pod IP by setting up `prometheus_url` to https://%%host%%:443/metrics

instances:

    ## @param prometheus_url - string - required
    ## The URL where your application metrics are exposed by Prometheus.
    ## It could be either the address of the metrics server service or
    ## the address of the pod itself.
    ## Please note that monitoring an exposed service of the metrics server
    ## that is backed by more than one pod could lead to inaccurate metrics
    ## because of to the load balancing. In this case, it is recommended to
    ## enable endpoint checks alongside the service check and use autodiscovery
    ## to get pod IP by setting up `prometheus_url` to https://%%host%%/metrics
    #
  - prometheus_url: http://localhost:443/metrics

    ## @param tags - list of key:value elements - optional
    ## List of tags to attach to every metrics, events and service checks emitted by this integration.

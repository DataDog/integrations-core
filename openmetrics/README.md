# OpenMetrics Integration

## Overview

Extract custom metrics from any OpenMetrics or Prometheus endpoints.

<div class="alert alert-warning">All the metrics retrieved by this integration are considered <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/metrics/custom_metrics">custom metrics</a>.</div>

The integration is compatible with both the [Prometheus exposition format][12] as well as with the [OpenMetrics specification][13].

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][1] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The OpenMetrics check is packaged with the [Datadog Agent starting version 6.6.0][2].

### Configuration

Edit the `openmetrics.d/conf.yaml` file at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3]. See the [sample openmetrics.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

For each instance the following parameters are required:

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `openmetrics_endpoint` | The URL where your application metrics are exposed in Prometheus or OpenMetrics format (must be unique).                                                                                                                         |
| `namespace`      | The namespace to prepend to all metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `metrics`        | A list of metrics to retrieve as custom metrics. Add each metric to the list as `metric_name` or `metric_name: renamed` to rename it. The metrics are interpreted as regular expressions. Use `".*"` as a wildcard (`metric.*`) to fetch all matching metrics. **Note**: Regular expressions can potentially send a lot of custom metrics. |

**Note**: This is a new default OpenMetrics check example as of Datadog Agent version 7.32.0. If you previously implemented this integration, see the [legacy example][5].

**Note**: Starting in Datadog Agent v7.32.0, in adherence to the [OpenMetrics specification standard][11], counter names ending in `_total` must be specified without the `_total` suffix. For example, to collect `promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total`, specify the metric name `promhttp_metric_handler_requests`. This submits to Datadog the metric name appended with `.count`, `promhttp_metric_handler_requests.count`.

**Note**: This check has a limit of 2000 metrics per instance. The number of returned metrics is indicated when running the Datadog Agent [status command][6]. You can specify the metrics you are interested in by editing the configuration. To learn how to customize the metrics to collect, see the [Prometheus and OpenMetrics Metrics Collection][7] for more detailed instructions. If you need to monitor more metrics, contact [Datadog support][8].

For more configurations, see [Prometheus and OpenMetrics Metrics Collection][7].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `openmetrics` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

All metrics collected by the OpenMetrics check are forwarded to Datadog as custom metrics.

### Events

The OpenMetrics check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

The OpenMetrics check does not include any service checks.

## Troubleshooting

### High custom metrics billing

OpenMetrics configurations with generic wildcard values for the `metrics` option have significant impact on custom metrics billing.

Datadog recommends that you use specific metric names or partial metric name matches for more precise collection.

### Missing untyped metrics

By default, the integration skips metrics that come without a type on a Prometheus exposition. If you want to collect untyped metrics, you must explicitly specify their type in the `metrics` mapping, for example:

```yaml
  metrics:
    - "metric_without_type":
        "type": "gauge"
```

Remember that metric names can be specified as regular expressions, making it possible to specify the type for a set of metrics without listing all of them individually.

### Errors parsing the OpenMetrics payload with Agent 7.46 and above

Starting with version 3.0.0 of this integration, which is shipped by default with Agent 7.46 and above, the integration sends by default the `Accept` header set to `application/openmetrics-text;version=1.0.0,application/openmetrics-text;version=0.0.1;q=0.75,text/plain;version=0.0.4;q=0.5,*/*;q=0.1`. Previous versions set the `Accept` header to `text/plain`. The integration then dynamically determines which scraper to use based on the `Content-type` it receives from the server.

If you see errors scraping the OpenMetrics endpoint with this new version because the scraper is stricter than before, manually set the `Accept` header that the integration sends to `text/plain` using the `headers` option in the [configuration file][14]. For instance: 

```yaml
## All options defined here are available to all instances.
#
init_config:
  ...
instances:
  - openmetrics_endpoint: <OPENMETRICS_ENDPOINT>
  ...
    headers:
      - Accept: text/plain
```

With this configuration, the endpoint returns the `Content-type` set to `text/plain`, causing the integration to use the previous scraper.

The OpenMetrics integration reports an error parsing the payload when the system you are monitoring sends data that does not match their `Content-type` header. Setting the integration to accept `text/plain` content creates a workaround to address the problem in the short term.

To fix the root cause of the problem, reach out to the maintainers of the upstream system. Submit a bug report and ask them to fix the system so the payload and the Content-type set in the header match.

    # If you use NXDOMAIN as the `record_type`, an NXDOMAIN result is expected from the query,
    # and the check instance will report response time data.
    # In many DNS systems, NXDOMAIN results are uncached. Further a query for a unqualified domain
    # name that one expects to return an NXDOMAIN result can result in many dns queries, depending
    # on the resolver's configured search domain.
    # For these reasons, these queries are good candidates to monitor the worst-case performance of a DNS lookup.

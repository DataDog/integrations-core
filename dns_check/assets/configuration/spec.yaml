            description: |
              The record type to be queried to the name server.

              If you use NXDOMAIN as the `record_type`, an NXDOMAIN result is expected from the query,
              and the check instance reports response time data.

              In many DNS systems, NXDOMAIN results are uncached. Further a query for a unqualified domain
              name that one expects to return an NXDOMAIN result can result in many dns queries, depending
              on the resolver's configured search domain.

              For these reasons, these queries are good candidates to monitor the worst-case performance of a DNS lookup.

# Dotnetclr Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Dotnetclr service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor Dotnetclr states
* Be notified about Dotnetclr failovers and events.

## Installation

The Dotnetclr check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

## Configuration

1. Edit the `dotnetclr.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][6] to start collecting your Dotnetclr performance data.
    See the [sample dotnetclr.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5]

## Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][2] and look for `dotnetclr` under the Checks section.

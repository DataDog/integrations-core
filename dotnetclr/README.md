# Dotnetclr Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from dotnetclr service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor dotnetclr states
* Be notified about dotnetclr failovers and events.

## Installation

The Dotnetclr check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your servers.  

If you need the newest version of the Dotnetclr check, install the `dd-check-dotnetclr` package; this package's check overrides the one packaged with the Agent. See the [integrations-core repository README.md for more details](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core#installing-the-integrations).

## Configuration

Edit the `dotnetclr.yaml` file to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor

## Validation

When you run `datadog-agent info` you should see something like the following:

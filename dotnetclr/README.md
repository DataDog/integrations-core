# Dotnetclr Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from the .NET CLR service in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor .NET CLR states.
- Be notified about .NET CLR failovers and events.

## Setup

### Installation

The .NET CLR check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package. No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `dotnetclr.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3] to start collecting your .NET CLR performance data. See the [sample dotnetclr.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.
2. [Restart the Agent][5].

## Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `dotnetclr` under the Checks section.

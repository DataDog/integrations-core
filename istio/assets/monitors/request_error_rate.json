    "description": "The requests count metric indicates the overall throughput of requests between services in your mesh and increments whenever an Envoy sidecar receives an HTTP or gRPC request. This monitor alerts you when the error percentage of requests is high, indicating that more than 40% of requests are receiving a status code of 5xx, 4xx, or 0 in the last 15 minutes. This could indicate issues with the services in your mesh, such as misconfigurations, network problems, or service failures.",

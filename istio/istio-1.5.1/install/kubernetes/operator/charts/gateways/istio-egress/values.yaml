      # Set this to "external" if and only if you want the egress gateway to
      # act as a transparent SNI gateway that routes mTLS/TLS traffic to
      # external services defined using service entries, where the service
      # entry has resolution set to DNS, has one or more endpoints with
      # network field set to "external". By default its set to "" so that
      # the egress gateway sees the same set of endpoints as the sidecars
      # preserving backward compatibility
      # ISTIO_META_REQUESTED_NETWORK_VIEW: ""
      # A gateway with this mode ensures that pilot generates an additional

    # Specify the pod anti-affinity that allows you to constrain which nodes
    # your pod is eligible to be scheduled based on labels on pods that are
    # already running on the node rather than based on labels on nodes.
    # There are currently two types of anti-affinity:
    #    "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution"
    #    "preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution"
    # which denote "hard" vs. "soft" requirements, you can define your values
    # in "podAntiAffinityLabelSelector" and "podAntiAffinityTermLabelSelector"
    # correspondingly.
    # For example:
    # podAntiAffinityLabelSelector:
    # - key: security
    #   operator: In
    #   values: S1,S2
    #   topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
    # This pod anti-affinity rule says that the pod requires not to be scheduled
    # onto a node if that node is already running a pod with label having key
    # "security" and value "S1".

# Istio check

## Overview

Use the Datadog Agent to monitor how well Istio is performing.

* Collect metrics on what apps are making what kinds of requests
* Look at how applications are using bandwidth
* Understand istio's resource consumption

## Setup

### Installation

Istio is included in the Datadog Agent. So, just [install the Agent][1] on your istio servers or in your cluster and point it at Istio.

### Configuration

#### Preparing Istio

Istio needs to have the built in [prometheus adapter][2] enabled and the ports exposed to the agent.

#### Connect the Agent

Edit the `istio.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][8], to connect it to Istio. See the [sample istio.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options:

```
init_config:

instances:
  - istio_mesh_endpoint: http://istio-telemetry.istio-system:42422/metrics
    mixer_endpoint: http://istio-telemetry.istio-system:9093/metrics
    send_histograms_buckets: true
```

Both endpoints need to be connected to the check for it to work. To learn more about the prometheus adapter, you can read the [istio documentation][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand][5] and look for `istio` under the Checks section.

# Agent Check: Nagios

## Overview

Send events from your Nagios-monitored infrastructure to Datadog for richer alerting and to help correlate Nagios events with metrics from your Datadog-monitored infrastructure.

This check watches your Nagios server's logs and sends events to your Datadog event stream: track service flaps, host state changes, passive service checks, host and service downtimes, and more. The check can also send Nagios Perfdata as metrics to Datadog.

## Setup
### Installation

The Nagios check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Nagios servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `nagios.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory. See the [sample nagios.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options:

```
init_config:
  check_freq: 15 # default is 15

instances:
  - nagios_conf: /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg   # or wherever your main nagios conf is
    collect_events: True                   # default is True
    passive_checks_events: True            # default is False
    collect_host_performance_data: True    # default is False
    collect_service_performance_data: True # default is False
```

The Agent reads the main nagios configuration file to get the locations of the nagios log files it should watch.

This check also works with Icinga, the popular fork of Nagios. If you use Icinga, just set `nagios_conf` to the location of your Icinga configuration file.

[Restart the Agent][3] to start sending Nagios events and (optionally) perfdata metrics to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `nagios` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

With a default configuration, the Nagios check doesn't collect any metrics. But if you set `collect_host_performance_data` and/or `collect_service_performance_data` to `True`, the check watches for perfdata and sumbits it as gauge metrics to Datadog.

### Events

The check watches the Nagios events log for log lines containing these string, emitting an event for each such line:

- SERVICE FLAPPING ALERT
- ACKNOWLEDGE_SVC_PROBLEM
- SERVICE ALERT
- HOST ALERT
- PASSIVE SERVICE CHECK
- CURRENT SERVICE STATE
- ACKNOWLEDGE_HOST_PROBLEM
- CURRENT HOST STATE
- SERVICE NOTIFICATION
- HOST DOWNTIME ALERT
- PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT
- SERVICE DOWNTIME ALERT

### Service Checks
The Nagios check does not include any service checks at this time.

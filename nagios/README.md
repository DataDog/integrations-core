# Agent Check: Nagios

## Overview

Send events from your Nagios-monitored infrastructure to Datadog for richer alerting and to help correlate Nagios events with metrics from your Datadog-monitored infrastructure.

This check watches your Nagios server's logs and sends events to your Datadog event stream: track service flaps, host state changes, passive service checks, host and service downtimes, and more. This check can also send Nagios performance data as metrics to Datadog.

## Setup

Find below instructions to install and configure the check when running the Agent on a host. See the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates documentation][1] to learn how to apply those instructions to a containerized environment.

### Installation

The Nagios check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Nagios servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `nagios.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3]. See the [sample nagios.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

[Restart the Agent][5] to start sending Nagios events and (optionally) performance data metrics to Datadog.

#### Metrics collection
The Nagios check can potentially emit [custom metrics][6], which may impact your [billing][7].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][8] and look for `nagios` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

With the default configuration, the Nagios check doesn't collect any metrics. But if you set `collect_host_performance_data` and/or `collect_service_performance_data` to `True`, the check watches for Nagios performance data and submits it as gauge metrics to Datadog.

### Events

The check watches the Nagios events log for log lines containing these strings, emitting an event for each line:

- SERVICE FLAPPING ALERT
- ACKNOWLEDGE_SVC_PROBLEM
- SERVICE ALERT
- HOST ALERT
- PASSIVE SERVICE CHECK
- CURRENT SERVICE STATE
- ACKNOWLEDGE_HOST_PROBLEM
- CURRENT HOST STATE
- SERVICE NOTIFICATION
- HOST DOWNTIME ALERT
- PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT
- SERVICE DOWNTIME ALERT

### Service Checks
The Nagios check does not include any service checks.

# Agent Check: Nagios

## Overview

Send events from your Nagios-monitored infrastructure to Datadog for richer alerting and to help correlate Nagios events with metrics from your Datadog-monitored infrastructure.

This check watches your Nagios server's logs and sends events to your Datadog event stream: track service flaps, host state changes, passive service checks, host and service downtimes, and more. This check can also send Nagios performance data as metrics to Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

The Nagios check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Nagios servers.

### Configuration

Follow the instructions below to configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Containerized](#containerized) section.

#### Host

1. Edit the `nagios.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2]. See the [sample nagios.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][4] to start sending Nagios events and (optionally) performance data metrics to Datadog.

**Note**: The Nagios check can potentially emit [custom metrics][5], which may impact your [billing][6].

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][7] for guidance on applying the parameters below.

| Parameter            | Value                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` | `nagios`                                     |
| `<INIT_CONFIG>`      | blank or `{}`                                |
| `<INSTANCE_CONFIG>`  | `{"nagios_conf": "/etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg"}` |

**Note**: The containerized Agent should be able to access the `/etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg` file to enable the Datadog-Nagios integration.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][8] and look for `nagios` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

With the default configuration, the Nagios check doesn't collect any metrics. But if you set `collect_host_performance_data` and/or `collect_service_performance_data` to `True`, the check watches for Nagios performance data and submits it as gauge metrics to Datadog.

### Events

The check watches the Nagios events log for log lines containing these strings, emitting an event for each line:

- SERVICE FLAPPING ALERT
- ACKNOWLEDGE_SVC_PROBLEM
- SERVICE ALERT
- HOST ALERT
- PASSIVE SERVICE CHECK
- CURRENT SERVICE STATE
- ACKNOWLEDGE_HOST_PROBLEM
- CURRENT HOST STATE
- SERVICE NOTIFICATION
- HOST DOWNTIME ALERT
- PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT
- SERVICE DOWNTIME ALERT

### Service Checks

The Nagios check does not include any service checks.

Enable local check only after installing it in agent docker container.
This avoids crashing the container with a version of the check that comes bundled with the agent before we load the local version of the check.
For now limited to docker since that addresses an immediate CI issue. We'll extend it to native agent once we observe it and iron out any kinks.

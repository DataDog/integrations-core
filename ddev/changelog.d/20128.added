Added new commands to track and analyze size changes in integrations and dependencies:
- **`ddev size status`**: Shows current sizes of all modules.
- **`ddev size diff [COMMIT_BEFORE] [COMMIT_AFTER]`**: Compares size changes between two commits.
- **`ddev size timeline {integration | dependency} [INTEGRATION_NAME/DEPENDENCY_NAME]`**: Visualizes the size evolution of a module over time.

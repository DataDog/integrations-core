- Updated the `ddev size diff` command syntax from:  
  ```bash
  ddev size diff old_commit new_commit
  ```
  to 
  ```bash
  ddev size diff new_commit --compare-to old_commit
  ```
  If `--compare-to` is not provided, the command now defaults to comparing against the merge base,
  or the previous commit when on the master branch.

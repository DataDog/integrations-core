      What does this PR do?\r\nMigrates `ddev validate licenses` command from datadog_checks_dev
      to ddev.\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\nI did not test parts of the code (ex:
      checking for the correct format of the 3rd party extra license csv files) because
      of an issue (https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy/issues/716) with multithreading
      HTTPX requests. \r\n\r\n### Review checklist (to be filled by reviewers)\r\n\r\n-
      [ ] Feature or bugfix MUST have appropriate tests (unit, integration, e2e)\r\n-
      [ ] PR title must be written as a CHANGELOG entry [(see why)](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-title)\r\n-
      [ ] Files changes must correspond to the primary purpose of the PR as described
      in the title (small unrelated changes should have their own PR)\r\n- [ ] PR
      must have `changelog/` and `integration/` labels attached\r\n- [ ] If the PR
      doesn''t need to be tested during QA, please add a `qa/skip-qa` label.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DataDog/integrations-core/issues/15475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DataDog/integrations-core/issues/15475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}]'

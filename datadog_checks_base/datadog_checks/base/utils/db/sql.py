    Normalize the SQL query value to be used as a tag on metrics.

    HACK: This function substitutes ascii commas in the query with a special unicode
    character which is not normalized into a comma by metrics backend. This is a temporary
    hack to work around the bugs in the "Arbitrary Tag Values" feature on the backend
    which allows for any unicode string characters to be used as tag values without being
    escaped. Ascii commas in tag values are not currently supported in the query language,
    so this replacement is a workaround to display commas in tags but still allow metric
    queries to work.

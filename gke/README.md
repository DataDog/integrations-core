# GKE Integration

## Overview

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), a service on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), is a hosted platform for running and orchestrating containerized applications. Similar to Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS), GKE manages Docker containers deployed on a cluster of machines. However, unlike ECS, GKE uses Kubernetes.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure that your role in your [GCP project][1] has the proper permissions to use GKE. 

2. Enable the [Google Container Engine API][2] for your project. 

3. Install the [Google Cloud SDK][3] and the `kubectl` command line tool on your local machine. Once you [pair the Cloud SDK with your GCP account][4], you can control your clusters directly from your local machine using `kubectl`.

4. Create a small GKE cluster named `doglib` with the ability to access the Cloud Datastore by running the following command:

```
$  gcloud container clusters create doglib --num-nodes 3 --zone "us-central1-b" --scopes "cloud-platform"
```

### Set up the GCE integration 

Install the [Google Cloud Platform][5] integration.

You can then access an out-of-the-box [Google Compute Engine dashboard][6] that displays metrics like disk I/O, CPU utilization, and network traffic.

### Set up the GKE integration

Choose a mode of operation. A *mode of operation* refers to the level of flexibility, responsibility, and control that you have over your cluster. GKE offers two modes of operation:

- **Standard**: You manage the cluster's underlying infrastructure, giving you node configuration flexibility.

- **Autopilot**: Google provisions and manages the entire cluster's underlying infrastructure, including nodes and node pools, giving you an optimized cluster with a hands-off experience.

#### Standard

Deploy a [containerized version of the Datadog Agent][7] on your Kubernetes cluster. See [Install the Datadog Agent on Kubernetes][8].

#### Autopilot

Follow the instructions in the GKE [Autopilot section][14] of the Kubernetes distributions page.

#### Admission Controller
 
To use [Admission Controller][102] with Autopilot, set the [`configMode`][103] of the Admission Controller to either `service` or `hostip`. 

Because Autopilot does not allow `socket` mode, Datadog recommends using `service` (with `hostip` as a fallback) to provide a more robust layer of abstraction for the controller.

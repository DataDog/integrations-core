  # The kubernetes check retrieves metrics from cadvisor running under kubelet on each node.
  # It also queries kubelet for its health and the list of local-running pods.
  #
  # By default we assume we're running under docker and
  # that the kubelet read-only port with no auth is enabled.
  #
  # In this case we will use the address of the default router to
  # reach the kubelet and cadvisor APIs unless the environment variable
  # KUBERNETES_KUBELET_HOST is found (if your node names can be resolved by pods, we recommend you set this variable to spec.nodeName through the downward API).
  #
  # To enable Kubernetes State Metrics, please refer to kubernetes_states integration.
  # For more information,
  # please consult http://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/kubernetes/#kubernetes-state-metrics
  # and https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/ on the kubernetes_state directory.
  #
  # If the read-only endpoint is disabled, the check will query kubelet over HTTPS
  #
  # To override this behavior, e.g. in the case of a standalone cadvisor instance, use the following:
  #
  # host: localhost
  # port: 4194
  # method: http

  # cAdvisor port
 - port: 4194

  # cAdvisor host
  # host: localhost

  # API server host and port
  # Autodetected via the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST variable if present
  #
  # api_server_host: localhost
  # api_server_port: 443

  # Authentication against the apiserver
  #
  # By default the agent authenticates against the apiserver with its service account bearer token.
  # X509 certificate authentication is also supported.
  # To enable cert auth in place of bearer token auth, provide here the paths to
  # a client cert/key pair.
  # The recommended way to expose these files to the agent is by using Kubernetes Secrets.
  #
  # apiserver_client_crt: /path/to/client.crt
  # apiserver_client_key: /path/to/client.key
  #
  # Similarly we use the default CA cert of the agent's service account to verify the
  # apiserver's identity, but a custom one can be specified here.
  # apiserver_ca_cert: /path/to/cacert.crt
  #
  # collect_events controls whether the agent should fetch events from the kubernetes API and
  # ingest them in Datadog. To avoid duplicates, only one agent at a time across the entire
  # cluster should have this feature enabled. To enable the feature, set the parameter to `true`.
  #
  # collect_events: false
  #
  # Matching the pods to Kubernetes services requires to retrieve events regularly.
  # To reduce the traffic to the apiserver, we only query them every 5 minutes, adding a delay
  # in pod -> service matching. You can configure it below (in seconds) or disable kube_service
  # tagging completely
  #
  # collect_service_tags: true
  # service_tag_update_freq: 300

  # The namespaces for which events should be collected.
  # If not modified, the 'default' namespace will be used.
  #
  # namespaces:
  #  - default

  # The regexp used to select namespaces for which events should be collected.
  # The matched namespaces will be added to the "namespaces" list.
  # If empty, regexp selection will be ignored.

  # namespace_name_regexp:

  # use_histogram controls whether we send detailed metrics, i.e. one per container.
  # When false, we send detailed metrics corresponding to individual containers, tagging by container id
  # to keep them unique.
  # When true, we aggregate data based on container image.

  #
  # TLS configuration for querying kubelet.
  #
  # Available options are:
  # (server auth)
  # - simple TLS validation (with readily available certificates)
  # - disabling TLS validation
  # - providing the server certificate
  # (client auth)
  # - providing a client cert/key pair
  # - using a service account bearer token
  #
  # The default is to try and use the read-only port that doesn't require TLS
  # And to fall back to the HTTPS API with simple TLS validation.
  #
  # Explicitly disabling tls_verify should be used with caution:
  # if an attacker sniffs the agent requests they will see the agent's service account bearer token.
  #
  # Providing a server cert enables TLS validation.
  #
  # It is possible to providing a client cert/key pair for client auth.
  # If no such cert is passed, the agent authenticates using its pod bearer token (if available)
  # when querying kubelet and the apiserver. Its path can also be set with bearer_token_path.
  #
  # The recommended way to pass certificates and keys to the agent is by using
  # "Secret" Kubernetes object (and to mount them as volumes).
  #
  # kubelet_tls_verify: True

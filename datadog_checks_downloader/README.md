# Datadog Checks Downloader

## Overview

This package provides the secure downloader used by the [Datadog Agent][1] to
download Agent-based Integrations (also known as _Checks_). Internally, it uses
[The Update Framework (TUF)][2] and [in-toto][3] in order to provide
_end-to-end verification_ of integrations between our developers and end-users.
There is a blog post forthcoming shortly that will explain in more detail the
security guarantees. Interested readers may also wish to consult our KubeCon
2018 [talk][4] for more details.

Presently, the downloader is limited to downloading packages of
[integrations-core][5], but not [integrations-extras][6].

## Installation

This package is expected to be built and included with the DataDog Agent
beginning with version 6.10.0. There is a blog post forthcoming shortly that
will explain in more detail how to use the Datadog Agent to transparently
download and install new or updated integrations.

## Development

Create a dedicated virtualenv and follow the instructions in this paragraph
to work with the check.

To install the check in dev mode:

```shell
pip install -e .[dev]
```

To download a new or updated integration, you may specify a precise
[version][7]:

```shell
python -m datadog_checks.downloader -vvvv datadog-$INTEGRATION --version X.Y.Z
```

Or you may leave the version unspecified to download the latest version:

```shell
python -m datadog_checks.downloader -vvvv datadog-$INTEGRATION
```

To run the tests, [install tox][8] and just run:

```shell
tox
```

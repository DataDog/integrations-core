"""
A module with a function that substitutes parameters for
in-toto inspections. The function is expected to be called
'substitute', and takes one parameter, target_relpath, that specifies
the relative target path of the given Python package. The function is
expected to return a dictionary which maps parameter names to
parameter values, so that in-toto can substitute these parameters in
order to perform a successful inspection.
The module is expected to live here.

## Overview

[Asana][1] is a cloud-based work management tool designed to help individuals and teams keep track of tasks, delegate responsibilities, monitor progress, and communicate in real-time. By providing a centralized platform for collaboration, Asana helps teams stay organized and focused, ensuring that projects are completed on time.

This integration ingests the following logs:

- **Audit Logs**: Audit logs provide a detailed record of significant events, enabling your teams to identify and mitigate the impact of incidents as they arise, while also reviewing configuration changes with precision.

This integration gathers audit logs and forwards them to Datadog for seamless analysis. Datadog leverages its built-in log pipelines to parse and enrich these logs, facilitating easy search and detailed insights. With preconfigured dashboards, the integration offers clear visibility into activities within the Asana platform. Additionally, it includes ready-to-use Cloud SIEM detection rules for enhanced monitoring and security.

**Disclaimer**: By enabling this integration, you consent to the integration accessing your content and data from Asana. Asana is not responsible for the privacy, security, or integrity of any of your data outside the Asana services.

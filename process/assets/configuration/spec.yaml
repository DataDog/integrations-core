          Changes the check refresh rate of the matching pid list every X seconds except if it
          detects a change before. You might want to set it low if you want to
          alert on process service checks.

        description: |
          The check maintains a list of PIDs for which it got access denied. It won't try to look at them again for the
          duration in seconds specified by access_denied_cache_duration.

          The check maintains a list of running processes shared among all instances, that is used to generate the
          matching pid list on each instance. It won't try to look at them again for the duration in seconds
          specified by shared_process_list_cache_duration.

          If one of the elements in the list matches, it return the count of
          all the processes that match the string exactly by default. Change this behavior with the
          parameter `exact_match: false`.

          Note: One and only one of search_string, pid or pid_file must be specified per instance.

          Notes:
            * agent v6.11+ on windows runs as an unprivileged `ddagentuser`, so make sure to grant it read access to
              the PID files you specify in this option.

          Matches your search_string on proc.name().
          If you want to match on a substring within proc.cmdline(), set this to false
          Regex is also supported when this flag is set to `false`.

          Note: agent v6.11+ on windows runs as an unprivileged `ddagentuser` that does not have acces to the full
          command line of processes running under a different user. This option cannot be used in such cases.

          The threshold parameter is composed of two ranges: critical and warning

                       above the second one, the process check returns WARNING. To make an semi-unbounded interval,
                       use `.inf` for the upper bound.
            * critical: (optional) List of two values: If the number of processes found is below the first value or

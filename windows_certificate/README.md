# Agent Check: Windows Certificate Store

## Overview

This integration monitors the Local Machine certificates in the [Windows Certificate Store][1] to check whether any of have expired.

## Setup

### Installation

The Windows Certificate Store integration is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package but requires configuration (see instructions below).

### Configuration

Edit the `windows_certificate.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][10]. See the [`sample windows_certificate.d/conf.yaml`][4] for all available configuration options. When you are done editing the configuration file, [restart the Agent][5] to load the new configuration.

The integration can monitor the expiration of all certificates in a given store or selectively monitor specific certificates from a given list of strings matching with the certificate subjects. The store names that are available for monitoring are listed in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SystemCertificates`.

This example configuration monitors all certificates in the local machine's `ROOT` store:

```yaml
instances:
  - certificate_store: ROOT
```
This example configuration monitors certificates in `ROOT` that have `microsoft` or `verisign` in the subject:
```yaml
instances:
  - certificate_store: ROOT
    certificate_subjects:
      - microsoft
      - verisign
```
The parameters `days_warning` and `days_critical` are used to specify the number of days before certificate expiration from which the service check `windows_certificate.cert_expiration` begins emitting WARNING/CRITICAL alerts. In the below example the service check emits a WARNING alert when a certificate is 10 days from expiring and CRITICAL when it is 5 days away from expiring:
```yaml
instances:
  - certificate_store: ROOT
    certificate_subjects:
      - microsoft
      - verisign
    days_warning: 10
    days_critical: 5
```

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `windows_certificate` under the Checks section.

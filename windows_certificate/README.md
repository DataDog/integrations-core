# Agent Check: Windows Certificate Store

## Overview

This integration monitors the Local Machine certificates in the [Windows Certificate Store][1] to check whether any have expired.

## Setup

### Installation

The Windows Certificate Store integration is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package but requires configuration (see instructions below). The Windows Certificate Store integration requires Agent versions 7.67.0 or later.

### Configuration

Edit the `windows_certificate.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][10]. See the [`sample windows_certificate.d/conf.yaml`][4] for all available configuration options. When you are done editing the configuration file, [restart the Agent][5] to load the new configuration.

The integration can monitor the expiration of all certificates in a given store or selectively monitor specific certificates from a given list of strings matching with the certificate subjects. The store names that are available for monitoring are listed in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SystemCertificates`.

This example configuration monitors all certificates in the local machine's `ROOT` store:

```yaml
instances:
  - certificate_store: ROOT
```
This example configuration monitors certificates in `ROOT` that have `microsoft` or `verisign` in the subject:
```yaml
instances:
  - certificate_store: ROOT
    certificate_subjects:
      - microsoft
      - verisign
```
The parameters `days_warning` and `days_critical` are used to specify the number of days before certificate expiration from which the service check `windows_certificate.cert_expiration` begins emitting WARNING/CRITICAL alerts. In the below example the service check emits a WARNING alert when a certificate is 10 days from expiring and CRITICAL when it is 5 days away from expiring:
```yaml
instances:
  - certificate_store: ROOT
    certificate_subjects:
      - microsoft
      - verisign
    days_warning: 10
    days_critical: 5
```
Beginning with Agent v7.69.0, the integration can monitor the expiration of [certificate revocation lists (CRL)][11] in a given certificate store. When CRL monitoring is enabled, all CRLs in that store are monitored. To enable CRL monitoring, set `enable_crl_monitoring: true` in the integration.

This example configuration monitors Microsoft and Verisign certificates, and all CRLs in the local machine's `CA` store:

```yaml
instances:
  - certificate_store: CA
    certificate_subjects:
      - microsoft
      - verisign
    enable_crl_monitoring: true
```

Begnning with Agent v7.70, the integration can validate certificates and their certificate chains. To enable the certificate chain validation, set the following in the integration:
```yaml
instances:    
  - certificate_store: CA
    cert_chain_validation:
      enabled: true
      policy_validation_flags:
        - CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_IGNORE_ALL_NOT_TIME_VALID_FLAGS
        - CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_IGNORE_ALL_REV_UNKNOWN_FLAGS
        - CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_CA_FLAG 
```
The `policy_validation_flags` [suppress specific validation errors][12] that may not be relevant for your use case. See the [`sample windows_certificate.d/conf.yaml`][4] for a list of all the flags available for use.

### Tags

The integration automatically tags all metrics and service checks with the name of the store in the `certificate_store:<STORE>` tag. Certificate metrics and service checks are tagged with the certificate's subjects, thumbprints and serial numbers. CRL metrics and service checks are tagged with the CRL's issuer and thumbprint.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `windows_certificate` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Events

# Active Directory Integration

## Overview

Get metrics and logs from Microsoft Active Directory to visualize and monitor its performances.

## Setup

### Installation

The Agent's Active Directory check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

If installing the Datadog Agent on a domain environment, see [the installation requirements for the Agent][2]

### Configuration

#### Metric collection

1. Edit the `active_directory.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3] to start collecting your Active Directory performance data. The default setup should already collect metrics for the localhost. See the [sample active_directory.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5]

**Note**: Versions 1.13.0 or later of this check use a new implementation for metric collection, which requires Python 3. For hosts that are unable to use Python 3, or if you would like to use a legacy version of this check, refer to the following [config][10].

#### Log collection

<!-- partial
{{< site-region region="us3" >}}
**Log collection is not supported for the Datadog {{< region-param key="dd_site_name" >}} site**.
{{< /site-region >}}
partial -->

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, you need to enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `active_directory.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Active Directory Logs:

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: file
       path: /path/to/my/directory/file.log
       source: ruby
       service: "<MY_SERVICE>"
   ```

   Change the `path` and `service` parameter values and configure them for your environment.
   See the [sample active_directory.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

3. This integration is intended for the [Active Directory Module for Ruby][6]. If you are not using the Ruby module, change the `source` value to `active_directory` and configure the `path` for your environment.

4. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `active_directory` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][8] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

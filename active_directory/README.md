# Active Directory Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Microsoft Active Directory to visualize and monitor its performances.

## Setup

### Installation

The Agent's Active Directory check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

If installing the Datadog Agent on a domain environment, see [the installation requirements for the Agent][2]

### Configuration

#### Metric collection

1. Edit the `active_directory.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3] to start collecting your Active Directory performance data. The default setup should already collect metrics for the localhost. See the [sample active_directory.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5]

**Note**: Versions 1.13.0 or later of this check use a new implementation for metric collection, which requires Python 3. For hosts that are unable to use Python 3, or if you would like to use a legacy version of this check, refer to the following [config][10].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `active_directory` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][8] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

The integration collects metrics from the following Windows performance objects:

- **NTDS**: Core Active Directory metrics including replication, LDAP operations, and directory service threads
- **Netlogon**: Authentication performance metrics including semaphore statistics for monitoring authentication bottlenecks
- **Security System-Wide Statistics**: Authentication protocol usage metrics (NTLM vs Kerberos)
- **DHCP Server**: DHCP failover and binding update metrics (when DHCP Server role is installed)
- **DFS Replicated Folders**: DFS replication health, conflicts, and staging metrics (when DFSR role is installed)
  - Note: Metrics are tagged with `instance` containing the DFS replication group name

#### Netlogon Metrics

The Netlogon metrics help monitor authentication performance and identify bottlenecks in domain controller authentication processing:

- `active_directory.netlogon.semaphore_waiters`: Number of threads waiting for the authentication semaphore
- `active_directory.netlogon.semaphore_holders`: Number of threads currently holding the semaphore
- `active_directory.netlogon.semaphore_acquires`: Total number of semaphore acquisitions
- `active_directory.netlogon.semaphore_timeouts`: Number of timeouts waiting for the semaphore
- `active_directory.netlogon.semaphore_hold_time`: Average time (in seconds) the semaphore is held

These metrics are particularly useful for monitoring authentication load from network access control (NAC) devices, Wi-Fi authentication, and other authentication-heavy scenarios.

##### Use Cases

The Netlogon and Security metrics help address several monitoring scenarios:

- **Monitor authentication bottlenecks**: Identify when authentication requests are queuing up, particularly from Cisco ISE NAC devices or high-volume Wi-Fi authentication
- **Track authentication processing times**: Use `semaphore_hold_time` to determine if authentication is taking too long
- **Identify MaxConcurrentApi tuning needs**: High `semaphore_waiters` values indicate the need to adjust the MaxConcurrentApi registry setting
- **Monitor authentication protocol usage**: Track the ratio of NTLM vs Kerberos authentications to ensure proper protocol usage
- **Detect authentication timeouts and failures**: Rising `semaphore_timeouts` indicate authentication infrastructure issues

### Events

The Active Directory check does not include any events.

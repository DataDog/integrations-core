# active_directory Integration

## Overview

Get metrics and logs from Microsoft Active Directory to visualize and monitor its performances.

## Setup

### Installation

The Agent's Active Directory check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

#### Metric collection

1. Edit the `active_directory.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2] to start collecting your Active Directory performance data. The default setup should already collect metrics for the localhost. See the [sample active_directory.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][4]

#### Log collection

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, you need to enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `active_directory.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Active Directory Logs:

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: file
       path: /path/to/my/directory/file.log
       source: ruby
       service: "<MY_SERVICE>"
   ```

   Change the `path` and `service` parameter values and configure them for your environment.
   See the [sample active_directory.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

3. This integration is intended for the [Active Directory Module for Ruby][5]. If you are not using the Ruby module, change the below source value to `active_directory` and configure the `path` for your environment.

4. [Restart the Agent][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `active_directory` under the Checks section.

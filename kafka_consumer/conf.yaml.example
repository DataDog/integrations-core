  # When checking Kafka offsets stored in Zookeeper, a single run of this check
  # must stat zookeeper more than the number of consumers * topic_partitions
  # that you're monitoring. If that number is greater than 100, it's recommended
  # to increase this value to avoid hitting zookeeper too hard.

  # Please note that to avoid blindly collecting offsets and lag for an
  # unbounded number of partitions (as could be the case after introducing
  # the self discovery of consumer groups, topics and partitions) the check
  # will collect at metrics for at most 100 partitions.

instances:
  # In a production environment, it's often useful to specify multiple
  # Kafka / Zookeper nodes for a single check instance. This way you
  # only generate a single check process, but if one host goes down,
  # KafkaClient / KazooClient will try contacting the next host.

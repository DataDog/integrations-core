# Agent Check: Kafka Consumer

![Kafka Dashboard][111]

## Overview

This Agent check only collects metrics for message offsets. If you want to collect JMX metrics from the Kafka brokers or Java-based consumers/producers, see the kafka check.

This check fetches the highwater offsets from the Kafka brokers, consumer offsets that are stored in kafka or zookeeper (for old-style consumers), and the calculated consumer lag (which is the difference between the broker offset and the consumer offset).

## Setup

Find below instructions to install and configure the check when running the Agent on a host. See the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates documentation][112] to learn how to apply those instructions to a containerized environment.

### Installation

The Agent's Kafka consumer check is included in the [Datadog Agent][113] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Kafka nodes.

### Configuration

Create a `kafka_consumer.yaml` file using [this sample configuration file][114] as an example. Then [restart the Datadog Agent][115] to start sending metrics to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][116] and look for `kafka_consumer` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics
See [metadata.csv][117] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Events

`consumer_lag`:

The Datadog Agent emits an event when the value of the `consumer_lag` metric goes below 0, tagging it with `topic`,
`partition` and `consumer_group`.

### Service Checks
The Kafka-consumer check does not include any service checks.

# Agent Check: Kafka Consumer

![Kafka Dashboard][111]

## Overview

This Agent check only collects metrics for message offsets. If you want to collect JMX metrics from the Kafka brokers or Java-based consumers/producers, see the kafka check.

This check fetches the highwater offsets from the Kafka brokers, consumer offsets that are stored in kafka or zookeeper (for old-style consumers), and the calculated consumer lag (which is the difference between the broker offset and the consumer offset).

**Note:** This integration ensures that consumer offsets are checked before broker offsets because worst case is that consumer lag is a little overstated. Doing it the other way around can understate consumer lag to the point of having negative values, which is a dire scenario usually indicating messages are being skipped.

## Setup

### Installation

The Agent's Kafka consumer check is included in the [Datadog Agent][112] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Kafka nodes.

### Configuration

#### Host

Follow the instructions below to configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Containerized](#containerized) section.

1. Edit the `kafka_consumer.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agentâ€™s configuration directory][114]. See the [sample kafka_consumer.d/conf.yaml][113] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][115].

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery with JMX][116] guide.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][117] and look for `kafka_consumer` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][118] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Events

**consumer_lag**:<br>
The Datadog Agent emits an event when the value of the `consumer_lag` metric goes below 0, tagging it with `topic`, `partition` and `consumer_group`.

### Service Checks

The Kafka-consumer check does not include any service checks.

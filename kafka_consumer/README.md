# Kafka Consumer Integration

![Kafka Dashboard][1]

## Overview

This Agent integration collects message offset metrics from your Kafka consumers. This check fetches the highwater offsets from the Kafka brokers, consumer offsets that are stored in Kafka (or Zookeeper for old-style consumers), and then calculates consumer lag (which is the difference between the broker offset and the consumer offset).

If you would benefit from visualizing the topology of your streaming data pipelines and identifying the root cause of bottlenecks, learn more about [Data Streams Monitoring][16].

**Note:** 
- This integration ensures that consumer offsets are checked before broker offsets; in the worst case, consumer lag may be a little overstated. Checking these offsets in the reverse order can understate consumer lag to the point of having negative values, which is a dire scenario usually indicating messages are being skipped.
- If you want to collect JMX metrics from your Kafka brokers or Java-based consumers/producers, see the [Kafka Broker integration][19].


## Setup

### Installation

The Agent's Kafka consumer check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package. No additional installation is needed on your Kafka nodes.

### Configuration

<!-- xxx tabs xxx -->
<!-- xxx tab "Host" xxx -->

#### Host

To configure this check for an Agent running on a host running your Kafka consumers:

##### Metric collection

1. Edit the `kafka_consumer.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3]. See the [sample kafka_consumer.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

##### Log collection

This check does not collect additional logs. To collect logs from Kafka brokers, see [log collection instructions for Kafka][6].

<!-- xxz tab xxx -->
<!-- xxx tab "Containerized" xxx -->

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][17] for guidance on applying the parameters below.

##### Metric collection

| Parameter            | Value                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` | `kafka_consumer`                     |
| `<INIT_CONFIG>`      | blank or `{}`                        |
| `<INSTANCE_CONFIG>`  | `{"kafka_connect_str": <KAFKA_CONNECT_STR>}` <br/>For example, `{"kafka_connect_str": "server:9092"}` |

##### Log collection

This check does not collect additional logs. To collect logs from Kafka brokers, see [log collection instructions for Kafka][6].

<!-- xxz tab xxx -->
<!-- xxz tabs xxx -->

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][8] and look for `kafka_consumer` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][9] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Events

**consumer_lag**:<br>
The Datadog Agent emits an event when the value of the `consumer_lag` metric goes below 0, tagging it with `topic`, `partition` and `consumer_group`.

### Service Checks

The Kafka-consumer check does not include any service checks.

**Kerberos GSSAPI Authentication**

Depending on your Kafka cluster's Kerberos setup, you may need to configure the following:

* Kafka client configured for the Datadog Agent to connect to the Kafka broker. The Kafka client should be added as a Kerberos principal and added to a Kerberos keytab. The Kafka client should also have a valid kerberos ticket. 
* TLS certificate to authenticate a secure connection to the Kafka broker.
  * If JKS keystore is used, a certificate needs to be exported from the keystore and the file path should be configured with the applicable `tls_cert` and/or `tls_ca_cert` options. 
  * If a private key is required to authenticate the certificate, it should be configured with the `tls_private_key` option. If applicable, the private key password should be configured with the `tls_private_key_password`. 
* `KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME` environment variable pointing to the Kafka client's Kerberos keytab location if it differs from the default path (for example, `KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME=/etc/krb5.keytab`)
* `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable pointing to the Kafka client's Kerberos credentials ticket cache if it differs from the default path (for example, `KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/krb5cc_xxx`)
* If the Datadog Agent is unable to access the environment variables, configure the environment variables in a Datadog Agent service configuration override file for your operating system. The procedure for modifying the Datadog Agent service unit file may vary for different Linux operating systems. For example, in a Linux `systemd` environment: 

**Linux Systemd Example**

1. Configure the environment variables in an environment file.
   For example: `/path/to/environment/file`

  ```
  KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME=/etc/krb5.keytab
  KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/krb5cc_xxx
  ```

2. Create a Datadog Agent service configuration override file: `sudo systemctl edit datadog-agent.service`

3. Configure the following in the override file:

  ```
  [Service]
  EnvironmentFile=/path/to/environment/file
  ```

4. Run the following commands to reload the systemd daemon, datadog-agent service, and Datadog Agent:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent.service
sudo service datadog-agent restart
```

# Agent Check: Kafka Consumer

## Overview

This Agent check only collects metrics for message offsets. If you want to collect metrics about the Kafka brokers themselves, see the kafka check.

This check fetches the highwater offsets from the Kafka brokers, consumer offsets for old-style consumers that store their offsets in zookeeper, and the calculated consumer lag (which is the difference between those two metrics).

This check does NOT support Kafka versions > 0.8â€”it can't collect consumer offsets for new-style consumer groups which store their offsets in Kafka. If run such a version of Kafka, track [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/issues/457).

## Setup
### Installation

The Agent's Kafka consumer check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your Kafka nodes.  

If you need the newest version of the Kafka consumer check, install the `dd-check-kafka-consumer` package; this package's check overrides the one packaged with the Agent. See the [integrations-core repository README.md for more details](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core#installing-the-integrations).

### Configuration

Create a `kafka_consumer.yaml` file using [this sample conf file](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/kafka_consumer/conf.yaml.example) as an example. Then restart the Datadog Agent to start sending metrics to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/) and look for `kafka_consumer` under the Checks section:

```
  Checks
  ======
    [...]

    kafka_consumer
    -------
      - instance #0 [OK]
      - Collected 26 metrics, 0 events & 1 service check

    [...]
```

## Compatibility

The kafka_consumer check is compatible with all major platforms.

## Data Collected
### Metrics
See [metadata.csv](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/kafka_consumer/metadata.csv) for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Events

`consumer_lag`:

The Datadog Agent emits an event when the value of the `consumer_lag` metric goes below 0, tagging it with `topic`,
`partition` and `consumer_group`.

### Service Checks
The Kafka-consumer check does not include any service check at this time.

## Troubleshooting
### Specifying a non existent partition in your kafka_Consumer.yaml file
If you get this error in your info.log:
```
instance - #0 [Error]: ''
```

Specify the specific partition of your environment for your topic in your kafka_Consumer.yaml file:
```
#my_topic [0, 1, 4, 12]
```

# Agent Check: BentoML

## Overview

This check monitors [BentoML][1] through the Datadog Agent.

BentoML is an open-source platform for building, shipping, and running machine learning models in production. This integration enables you to track the health and performance of your BentoML model serving infrastructure directly from Datadog.

By using this integration, you gain visibility into key BentoML metrics such as request throughput, response latency, error rates, and resource utilization. Monitoring these metrics helps you ensure reliable model deployments, quickly detect issues, and optimize the performance of your ML services in production environments.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][3] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

Starting from agent 7.71.0,the BentoML check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package. No additional installation is needed on your environment. 

This check uses OpenMetrics to collect metrics from the OpenMetrics endpoint that BentoML exposes, which requires Python 3.

### Configuration

#### Metrics

The BentoML integration collects data from both the [health API endpoints][11] and the [Prometheus metrics endpoint][10]. By default, BentoML exposes these endpoints, so in most cases, no additional configuration is required on the BentoML side. For more information about these endpoints and how to enable or secure them, refer to the [BentoML observability documentation][11].

To configure the Datadog Agent to collect BentoML metrics:

1. Edit the `bentoml.d/conf.yaml` file, located in the `conf.d/` directory at the root of your Agent's configuration folder. This file controls how the Agent collects metrics from your BentoML deployment. For a full list of configuration options, see the [sample bentoml.d/conf.yaml][4]. Below is a minimal example configuration:

```yaml
init_config:
instances:
  - openmetrics_endpoint: http://localhost:3000/metrics
```

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

#### Logs

You can collect BentoML logs in several ways:

- **Agent log collection (recommended):** Configure the Datadog Agent to tail the log files generated by BentoML, as described in the [BentoML documentation][12].
- **Fluent Bit:** Forward logs to Datadog using [Fluent Bit][13].
- **OTLP:** Send logs via the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)][14] to the Datadog Agent.

Choose the method that best fits your environment and logging setup.


### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `bentoml` under the Checks section.

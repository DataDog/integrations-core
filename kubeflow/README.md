# Agent Check: Kubeflow

## Overview

This check monitors [Kubeflow][1] through the Datadog Agent. 


## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][3] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The Kubeflow check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package.
No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `kubeflow.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your kubeflow performance data. See the [sample kubeflow.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

#### Metric collection

Make sure that the Prometheus-formatted metrics are exposed for your `kubeflow` componenet. 
For the Agent to start collecting metrics, the `kubeflow` pods need to be annotated.

Kubeflow has metrics endpoints that can be accessed on port `9090`. 

To enable metrics exposure in kubeflow through prometheus, you might need to enable the prometheus service monitoring for the component in question.

You can use Kube-Prometheus-Stack or a custom Prometheus installation.

##### How to install Kube-Prometheus-Stack:
1. Add Helm Repository:
```
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

2. Install the Chart:
```
helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

3. Expose Prometheus service externally:
```
kubectl port-forward prometheus-stack 9090:9090
```
##### Set Up ServiceMonitors for Kubeflow Components:

You need to configure ServiceMonitors for Kubeflow components to expose their Prometheus metrics.
If your Kubeflow component exposes Prometheus metrics by default. You'll just need to configure Prometheus to scrape these metrics.

The ServiceMonitor would look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: <kubeflow-component>-monitor
  labels:
    release: prometheus-stack
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: <kubeflow-component-name>
  endpoints:
  - port: http
    path: /metrics
```

Where `<kubeflow-component>` is to be replaced by `pipelines`, `kserve` or `katib` and `<kubeflow-component-name>` is to be replaced by `ml-pipeline`, `kserve` or `katib`.


**Note**: The listed metrics can only be collected if they are available(depending on the version). Some metrics are generated only when certain actions are performed. 

The only parameter required for configuring the `kubeflow` check is `openmetrics_endpoint`. This parameter should be set to the location where the Prometheus-formatted metrics are exposed. The default port is `9090`. In containerized environments, `%%host%%` should be used for [host autodetection][3]. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
# (...)
metadata:
  name: '<POD_NAME>'
  annotations:
    ad.datadoghq.com/controller.checks: |
      {
        "kubeflow": {
          "init_config": {},
          "instances": [
            {
              "openmetrics_endpoint": "http://%%host%%:9090/metrics"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    # (...)
spec:
  containers:
    - name: 'controller'
# (...)
```

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `kubeflow` under the Checks section.

## Goal
Identify incidents where multiple high-severity files are detected within the same file path on a single host. This scenario suggests a potential concentration of malicious activity or an attempt to hide multiple threats within a specific location, warranting immediate investigation and response.

## Strategy
Monitor virus and malware events for instances where multiple high-severity files are identified in the same directory on a single host. Correlate these events to understand the nature of the files, assess the potential threat, and determine the likelihood of a coordinated or persistent attack.

## Triage and Response
1.  Identify the affected host, including its host name - `{{source_host_name}}`.
2.  Verify the specific events associated with the detection of high-severity files in the path - `{{file_path}}`.
3.  Determine whether the files are part of a known malware family, a targeted attack, or represent a broader compromise.
4.  Implement corrective actions such as quarantining or removing the files, securing the affected path, and conducting a thorough investigation to prevent further incidents.

## Overview

[Tanium][1] is an enterprise platform that's primarily used as an endpoint management tool. It empowers security and IT operations teams with quick visibility and control to secure and manage every endpoint on the network.

This integration ingests the following logs:

- **Threat Response Alerts**: This endpoint contains information about the core incident response lifecycle with integrated capabilities for alerting, analysis, containment, and remediation.
- **Threat Response Audit**: This endpoint contains information about the centralized view of audit events generated by the Tanium Threat Response.
- **Platform Audit**: This endpoint contains information about the authentication, API token usage, local settings, persona changes, user settings, and system settings information.

This integration collects logs from the sources listed above and sends them to Datadog for analysis with our Log Explorer and Cloud SIEM products
* [Log Explorer][3]
* [Cloud SIEM][4]

## Overview

[Tanium][1] is an enterprise platform designed for endpoint management. It provides security and IT operations teams with rapid visibility and control to secure and manage all network endpoints.

This integration ingests the following logs:

- **Threat Response Alerts**: This endpoint contains information about the core incident response lifecycle with integrated capabilities for alerting, analysis, containment, and remediation.
- **Threat Response Audit**: This endpoint contains information about the centralized view of audit events generated by the Tanium Threat Response.
- **Platform Audit**: This endpoint contains information about the authentication, API token usage, local settings, persona changes, user settings, and system settings information.

This integration collects logs from the sources listed above and transmits them to Datadog for analysis in [Log Explorer][3] and [Cloud SIEM][4].

# Etcd Integration
{{< img src="integrations/etcd/etcd_graph.png" alt="Etcd Graph" responsive="true" popup="true">}}
## Overview

Collect etcd metrics to:

* Monitor the health of your etcd cluster.
* Know when host configurations may be out of sync.
* Correlate the performance of etcd with the rest of your applications.

## Setup
### Installation

The etcd check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your etcd instance(s).

### Configuration

1. Edit the `etcd.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's directory to start collecting your etcd performance data.  
    See the [sample etcd.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

    ```yaml
	init_config:

	instances:
		- url: "https://server:port" # API endpoint of your etcd instance
    ```

2. [Restart the Agent][3]

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `etcd` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][5] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

etcd metrics are tagged with `etcd_state:leader` or `etcd_state:follower`, depending on the node status, so you can easily aggregate metrics by status.

### Events
The Etcd check does not include any event at this time.

### Service Checks

`etcd.can_connect`:

Returns 'Critical' if the Agent cannot collect metrics from your etcd API endpoint.

`etcd.healthy`:

Returns 'Critical' if a member node is not healthy. Returns 'Unknown' if the Agent can't reach the `/health` endpoint, or if the health status is missing.

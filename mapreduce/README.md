# Mapreduce Integration

![MapReduce Dashboard][1]

## Overview

Get metrics from mapreduce service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor mapreduce states
* Be notified about mapreduce failovers and events.

## Setup

Find below instructions to install and configure the check when running the Agent on a host. See the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates documentation][2] to learn how to apply those instructions to a containerized environment.

### Installation

The Mapreduce check is included in the [Datadog Agent][3] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `mapreduce.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][4] to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor. See the [sample mapreduce.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][6] and look for `mapreduce` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics
See [metadata.csv][7] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events
The Mapreduce check does not include any events.

### Service Checks
**mapreduce.resource_manager.can_connect**

Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent is unable to connect to the Resource Manager.
Returns `OK` otherwise.

**mapreduce.application_master.can_connect**

Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent is unable to connect to the Application Master.
Returns `OK` otherwise.

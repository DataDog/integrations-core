# Only applies to PRs
- script: git checkout -B $(System.PullRequest.SourceBranch)
  condition: eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')

# Azure pulls a commit hash via git fetch rather than clone so
# we checkout the branches we need which also gets us out of a
# detached HEAD state. This may be fixed soon, see:

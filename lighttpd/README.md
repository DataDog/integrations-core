## Overview

The Agent's lighttpd check tracks uptime, bytes served, requests per second, response codes, and more.

## Setup
### Installation

The lighttpd check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your lighttpd servers.

In addition, install `mod_status` on your Lighttpd servers.

### Configuration

1. Edit the  `lighttpd.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory.
	See the [sample lighttpd.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options:

    ```yaml
	init_config:

	instances:
	    # Each instance needs a lighttpd_status_url. Tags are optional.
      	- lighttpd_status_url: http://example.com/server-status?auto
	    #   tags:
	    #     - instance:foo
    ```

2. [Restart the Agent][3] to begin sending lighttpd metrics to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `lighttpd` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][5] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events
The Lighttpd check does not include any events at this time.

### Service Checks

`- lighttpd.can_connect`:

Returns CRITICAL if the Agent cannot connect to lighttpd to collect metrics, otherwise OK.

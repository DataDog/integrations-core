# Agent Check: Scylla

## Overview

This Datadog-[Scylla][1] integration collects a majority of the exposed metrics by default, with the ability to customize additional groups based on specific user needs.

Scylla is an open-source NoSQL data store that can act as "a drop-in Apache Cassandra alternative." It has rearchitected the Cassandra model tuned for modern hardware, reducing the size of required clusters while improving theoretical throughput and performance.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host.

### Installation

The Scylla check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package. No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `scylla.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your scylla performance data. See the [sample scylla.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `scylla` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Service Checks

# Agent Check: Scylla

## Overview

This Datadog-[Scylla][1] integration collects a majority of the exposed metrics by default, with the ability to customize additional groups based on specific user needs.

Scylla is an open-source NoSQL data store that can act as "a drop-in Apache Cassandra alternative." It has rearchitected the Cassandra model tuned for modern hardware, reducing the size of required clusters while improving theoretical throughput and performance.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host.

### Installation

The Scylla check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package. No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `scylla.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your scylla performance data. See the [sample scylla.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][4].

##### Log collection

Scylla has different modes of outputting logs depending on the environment it's running in.  See the [Scylla documentation][8] for more specifics on how the application generates logs.

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, enable it in your `datadog.yaml` file:

      ```yaml
       logs_enabled: true
     ```

2. Uncomment and edit the logs configuration block in your `scylla.d/conf.yaml` file. Change the `type`, `path`, and `service` parameter values based on your environment. See the [sample scylla.d/conf.yaml][9] for all available configuration options.

      ```yaml
       logs:
         - type: file
           path: <LOG_FILE_PATH>
           source: scylla
           sourcecategory: database
           service: <SERVICE_NAME>
           #To handle multi line that starts with yyyy-mm-dd use the following pattern
           #log_processing_rules:
           #  - type: multi_line
           #    pattern: \d{4}\-(0?[1-9]|1[012])\-(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])
           #    name: new_log_start_with_date
     ```

3. [Restart the Agent][4].

See [Datadog's documentation][10] for additional information on how to configure the Agent for log collection in Docker environments.
  
### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `scylla` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Service Checks

`scylla.prometheus.health`: Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent cannot reach the metrics endpoints, `OK` otherwise.

### Events

The Scylla check does not include any events.

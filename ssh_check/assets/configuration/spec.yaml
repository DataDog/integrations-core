          - name: force_sha1
            description: |
              Some older SSH servers only support SHA1 encryption. Moreover, some don't have the `server-sig-algs`
              extension installed, which means they don't tell their clients that they only support SHA1.
              The SSH client assumes SHA2 encryption, so it crashes when connecting to such a server.
              While it's strongly recommended to upgrade the SSH server to support the more secure SHA2, you can force
              the client to use SHA1 encryption by setting this option to 'true'.

              example: false

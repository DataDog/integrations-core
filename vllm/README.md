# Agent Check: vLLM

## Overview

This check monitors [vLLM][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host.

### Installation

The vLLM check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package.
No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `vllm.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your vllm performance data. See the [sample vllm.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `vllm` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The vLLM integration does not include any events.

### Service Checks

The vLLM integration does not include any service checks.

See [service_checks.json][7] for a list of service checks provided by this integration.

### Logs

Log collection is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. If you are running your Agent as a container, see [container installation][10] to enable log collection. If you are running a host Agent, see [host Agent][11] instead.
In either case, make sure that the `source` value for your logs is `vllm`. This setting ensures that the built-in processing pipeline finds your logs. To set your log configuration for a container, see [log integrations][12].

  # The full path to the varnishstat binary and can contain additional arguments.
  # In order to support monitoring a Varnish instance which is running as a Docker
  # container we need to wrap commands (varnishstat) with scripts which
  # perform a docker exec on the running container.  Passing along template variables
  # (%%host%%, %%port%%) allow for targeting the proper container via service discovery.
  - varnishstat: /usr/bin/varnishstat
    # List of field inclusion blobs that will be passed to varnishstat with the
    # -f options to filter which metrics to collect.
    # See https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/4.1/reference/varnishstat.html#options.
    # The exclusion filter with '^' is broken with 'varnishstat' version 4.0 to 4.1.6 and 5.0 to 5.1.2. See https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues/2320
    # Version 4.1.7 has been released and includes a fix for this. Using the exclusion blob with a broken version will silence the integration (no metric will be sent)
    # However, you can still use the inclusion blob with those versions.
    # metrics_filter:
    #  - ^VBE.*

    # The (optional) name will be used in the varnishstat command for the
    # -n argument and will add a name:$instancename tag to all metrics.
    # name: myvarnishinstance

    # The (optional) list of tags will be applied to every emitted metric.
    # tags:
    #   - instance:production

    # The (optional) path to the varnishadm binary will signal the check to
    # emit a service check status on backend health using `debug.health`.
    # Similar to the varnishstat command this path can contain additional arguments
    # in order to support service discovery.
    # The service check will be tagged by backend.
    # NOTE: The Agent must be able to access varnishadm as with root
    # privileges. You can configure your sudoers file for this:
    #
    # example /etc/sudoers entry:
    #   dd-agent ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/varnishadm
    #
    # varnishadm: /usr/bin/varnishadm

    # The (optional) path to the varnish secretfile will be used in the
    # varnishadm command, if enabled.
    # secretfile: /etc/varnish/secret

    # The (optional) parameters for specifying the host and port to connect to varnishadm
    # Defaults to "localhost" and "6082" 
    # daemon_host: localhost
    # daemon_port: 6082
    
## Log section (Available for Agent >=6.0)
#logs:

    # - type : (mandatory) type of log input source (tcp / udp / file)
    #   port / path : (mandatory) Set port if type is tcp or udp. Set path if type is file
    #   service : (mandatory) name of the service owning the log
    #   source : (mandatory) attribute that defines which integration is sending the logs
    #   sourcecategory : (optional) Multiple value attribute. Can be used to refine the source attribtue
    #   tags: (optional) add tags to each logs collected
    
  # - type: file
  #   path: /var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log
  #   source: varnish
  #   sourcecategory: http_web_access   
  #   service: varnish

              The full path to the varnishstat binary and can contain additional arguments.
              In order to support monitoring a Varnish instance which is running as a Docker
              container you need to wrap commands (varnishstat) with scripts which
              perform a docker exec on the running container.  Passing along template variables
              (%%host%%, %%port%%) allow for targeting the proper container via service discovery.
            value:
              type: string
              example: /usr/bin/varnishstat
          - name: metrics_filter
            required: false
            description: |
              List of field inclusion blobs that are passed to varnishstat with the
              -f options to filter which metrics to collect.

              See https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/4.1/reference/varnishstat.html#options.
              The exclusion filter with '^' is broken with 'varnishstat' version 4.0 to 4.1.6 and 5.0 to 5.1.2.
              See https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues/2320
              Version 4.1.7 has been released and includes a fix for this.
              Using the exclusion blob with a broken version silences the integration.
              However, you can still use the inclusion blob with those versions.
            value:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string

                - <FIELD_INCLUSION>
          - name: name
            required: false
            description: |
              The name used in the varnishstat command for the
              -n argument which will add a name:<INSTANCE_NAME> tag to all metrics.
            value:
              type: string
              example: <INSTANCE_NAME>
          - template: instances/default
          - name: varnishadm

            description: |
              The path to the varnishadm binary signals the check to
              emit a service check status on backend health using `debug.health`.
              Similar to the varnishstat command this path can contain additional arguments
              in order to support service discovery.

              The service check is tagged by backend.
            value:
              type: string
              example: /usr/bin/varnishadm

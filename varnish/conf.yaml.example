  # In order to support monitoring a Varnish instance which is running as a Docker
  # container we need to wrap commands (varnishstat) with scripts which
  # perform a docker exec on the running container.  Passing along template variables
  # (%%host%%, %%port%%) allow for targeting the proper container via service discovery.

    # List of field inclusion blobs that will be passed to varnishstat with the
    # -f options to filter which metrics to collect.
    # See https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/4.1/reference/varnishstat.html#options.
    # The exclusion filter with '^' is broken with 'varnishstat' version 4.0 to 4.1.6 and 5.0 to 5.1.2. See https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues/2320
    # Version 4.1.7 has been released and includes a fix for this. Using the exclusion blob with a broken version will silence the integration (no metric will be sent)
    # However, you can still use the inclusion blob with those versions.

    #  - ^VBE.*

    # The (optional) name will be used in the varnishstat command for the
    # -n argument and will add a name:$instancename tag to all metrics.
    # name: myvarnishinstance

    # The (optional) list of tags will be applied to every emitted metric.
    # tags:
    #   - instance:production

    # The (optional) path to the varnishadm binary will signal the check to
    # emit a service check status on backend health using `debug.health`.
    # Similar to the varnishstat command this path can contain additional arguments
    # in order to support service discovery.
    # The service check will be tagged by backend.
    # NOTE: The Agent must be able to access varnishadm as with root
    # privileges. You can configure your sudoers file for this:
    #
    # NOTE: These service checks only support up to version 4.x of Varnish
    # example /etc/sudoers entry:
    #   dd-agent ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/varnishadm
    #
    # varnishadm: /usr/bin/varnishadm

    # The (optional) path to the varnish secretfile will be used in the
    # varnishadm command, if enabled.
    # secretfile: /etc/varnish/secret

# ExtraHop

## Overview

[ExtraHop][1] applies machine learning techniques and rule-based monitoring to your wire data to identify unusual behaviors and potential risks to the security and performance of your network.

This integration ingests the following logs:

- Detection: Represents data of anomalous behavior identified by ExtraHop system.
- Investigation: Represents a collection of data related to a specific security investigation, including its status, assignment, and associated detections.

This integration seamlessly collects all the above listed logs, channeling them into Datadog for analysis. Leveraging the built-in logs pipeline, these logs are parsed and enriched, enabling effortless search and analysis. The integration provides insight into detections and investigations through the out-of-the-box dashboards.

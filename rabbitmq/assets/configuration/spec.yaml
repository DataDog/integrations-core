              The choices are:
                - If the field is left unspecified, no endpoint is used.
                - "detailed" means the /metrics/detailed endpoint is used.
                  You can also provide a query for this option, exactly as if you were making an HTTP request
                  to this endpoint. For example, `detailed?family=queue_consumer_count`.
                  You can specify this and the aggregated endpoint. In that case any duplicate metrics will
                  be taken from this endpoint and the corresponding aggregated ones dropped.

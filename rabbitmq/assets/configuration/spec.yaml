        Use the `nodes` parameters to specify the nodes you'd like to
        collect metrics on (up to 100 nodes).
        If you have less than 100 nodes, you don't have to set this parameter,
        the metrics are collected on all the nodes by default.

      description: |
        Use the `nodes_regexes` parameters to specify one or multiple regex to
        match the nodes you'd like to collect metrics on (up to 100 nodes).
        If you have less than 100 nodes, you don't have to set this parameter,

        Use the `queues` parameters to specify the queues you'd like to

        If you have less than 200 queues, you don't have to set this parameter,
        the metrics are collected on all the queues by default.
        If you have set up vhosts, set the queue names as `vhost_name/queue_name`.
        If you have `tag_families` enabled, the first captured group in the regex
        is used as the queue_family tag if no named group is specified.
        If you have named groups the tag names will be the named groups in regex.
        If you use multiplies groups and not all are named, the tags are going to be
        used only on the groups that contains names.

        Service checks and `rabbitmq.connections` metric:
        By default a list of all vhosts is fetched and each one is checked using the aliveness
        API and the metric `rabbitmq.connections` is collected.
        If you prefer only certain vhosts to be monitored with service checks
        and the number of `connections` then you can list the vhosts you care about in this parameter.

              Whether or not to include metrics from the aggregated endpoint (/metrics).

              You can learn more about this endpoint here:
              https://www.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html#default-endpoint

              Note: You must set this option to true if you do not specify the 'unaggregated_endpoint' option.

            description: |
              Specify an endpoint without aggregation to collect more detailed metrics.

              For example, you can collect metrics tagged by queue or by exchange.
              These metrics are served from the /metrics/detailed endpoint.
              You can learn more about it here:
              https://www.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html#detailed-endpoint

              For brevity, you only need to specify "detailed" to start using this endpoint.
              You can also provide a query exactly as if you were making an HTTP request
              to this endpoint. For example, `detailed?family=queue_consumer_count&family=node_metrics&vhost=myvhost`.

              You can specify both this and the aggregated endpoint.
              If you specify both endpoints, metrics from the unaggregated endpoint are prioritized
              over metrics from the aggregated endpoint in case of name clashes.

          For any named groups in your pattern the names of the groups are added as tag keys
          paired with the matched contents of the groups as tag values.

          as for the `queues` field.
          If you have `tag_families` enabled, the first captured group in the pattern is used
          as the `queue_family` tag.
          Named groups in your pattern behave like in `nodes_regexes`.
          Your pattern is compared to queue names and queue names prefixed by vhost.
          For example, if you have a vhost named "myvhost" and a queue named "myqueue", your
          pattern is compared to:
            - myqueue
            - myvhost/myqueue

                Which  unaggregated endpoint to use.
                The choices are:
                  - If the field is left unspecified, no endpoint is used.
                  - "detailed" means the /metrics/detailed endpoint is used.
                    You can also provide a query for this option, exactly as if you were making an HTTP request
                    to this endpoint. For example, `detailed?family=queue_consumer_count`.
                    You can specify this and the aggregated endpoint. In that case any duplicate metrics will
                    be taken from this endpoint and the corresponding aggregated ones dropped.
              value:
                type: string

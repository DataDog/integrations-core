              Note: This option must be set to true when 'unaggregated_endpoint' is unspecified.

              Which  unaggregated endpoint to use.
              The choices are:
                - If the field is left unspecified, no endpoint is used.
                - "per-object" means the /metrics/per-object endpoint is used.
                - "detailed" means the /metrics/detailed endpoint is used.
                  You can also provide a query for this option, exactly as if you were making an HTTP request
                  to this endpoint. For example, `detailed?family=queue_consumer_count`.

        description: |
          Use the `nodes` parameters to specify the nodes you'd like to

          If you have less than 100 nodes, you don't have to set this parameter,

          If you have less than 100 nodes, you don't have to set this parameter,

          If you have set up vhosts, set the queue names as `vhost_name/queue_name`.
          If you have `tag_families` enabled, the first captured group in the regex
          is used as the queue_family tag if no named group is specified.
          If you have named groups the tag names will be the named groups in regex.
          If you use multiplies groups and not all are named, the tags are going to be
          used only on the groups that contains names.

          Use the `queues_regexes` parameters to specify one or multiple regex to to match
          the queues you'd like to collect metrics on (up to 200 queues).
          If you have vhosts set up, the regex pattern needs to be formatted with vhost
          in the format of `<vhost>/<queue_name>`.

        ## @param url - string - required
        ## Base URL for OpenMetrics endpoints.
        #
        url: http://%%host%%:15692

        ## @param include_aggregated_endpoint - boolean - optional - default: true
        ## Whether or not to include metrics from the aggregated endpoint (/metrics).
        ##
        ## Note: This option must be set to true when 'unaggregated_endpoint' is unspecified.
        #
        # include_aggregated_endpoint: true

        ## @param unaggregated_endpoint - string - optional - default: detailed
        ## Which  unaggregated endpoint to use.
        ## The choices are:
        ##   - If the field is left unspecified, no endpoint is used.
        ##   - "detailed" means the /metrics/detailed endpoint is used.
        ##     You can also provide a query for this option, exactly as if you were making an HTTP request
        ##     to this endpoint. For example, `detailed?family=queue_consumer_count`.
        ##     You can specify this and the aggregated endpoint. In that case any duplicate metrics will
        ##     be taken from this endpoint and the corresponding aggregated ones dropped.
        #
        # unaggregated_endpoint: detailed

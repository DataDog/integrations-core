# Network check

![Network Dashboard][1]

## Overview

The network check collects TCP/IP stats from the host operating system.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host.

### Installation

The network check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your server.

To collect metrics with this integration, make sure the conntrack module is activated on your host. If it's not the case, run:

```shell
sudo modprobe nf_conntrack
sudo modprobe nf_conntrack_ipv4
sudo modprobe nf_conntrack_ipv6
```

### Configuration

1. The Agent enables the network check by default, but if you want to configure the check yourself, edit file `network.d/conf.yaml`, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3]. See the [sample network.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options:

   ```yaml
   init_config:

   instances:
     ## @param collect_connection_state - boolean - required
     ## Set to true to collect connection states for your interfaces
     ## Note: this will require either the command `ss` from system package `iproute2` or
     ## the command `netstat` from the system package `net-tools` to be installed
     #
     - collect_connection_state: false
   ```

2. [Restart the Agent][5] to effect any configuration changes.

**Note**:

Some conntrack metrics require running conntrack with privileged access to be retrieved.

Linux: Configure the following sudoers rule for this to work:

```shell
dd-agent ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/conntrack -S
```

Kubernetes: Conntrack metrics are available by default in Kubernetes < v1.11 or when using the `host` networking mode in Kubernetes v1.11+.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][6] and look for `network` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][7] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

**Note**: `system.net.conntrack` metrics are available with Agent v6.12+. See the [CHANGELOG][8] for details.

### Events

The Network check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

The Network check does not include any service checks.

# Network check

![Network Dashboard][9]

## Overview

The network check collects TCP/IP stats from the host operating system.

## Setup
### Installation

The network check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your server.

### Configuration

1. The Agent enables the network check by default, but if you want to configure the check yourself, edit file `network.d/conf.yaml`, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory.
  See the [sample network.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options:

    ```yaml
      init_config:

      instances:
        # Network check only supports one configured instance
        - collect_connection_state: false # set to true to collect TCP connection state metrics, e.g. SYN_SENT, ESTABLISHED
          excluded_interfaces: # the check will collect metrics on all other interfaces
            - lo
            - lo0
      # ignore any network interface matching the given regex:
      #   excluded_interface_re: eth1.*
    ```

2. [Restart the Agent][3] to effect any configuration changes.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `network` under the Checks section.

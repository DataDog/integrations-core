              Set to true to collect connection states for your interfaces
              Note: this will require either the command `ss` from system package `iproute2` or
              the command `netstat` from the system package `net-tools` to be installed

              Note: connection queues collections require both
              `collect_connection_state` and `collect_connection_queues` to be true
              because it also requires the command `ss` from system package `iproute2` or
              the command `netstat` from the system package `net-tools` to be installed

              The location of the conntrack executable in order to get the stats from conntrack -S.
              It will be run with sudo by default, so an entry needs to be added to the sudoers file.
              By default, these metrics will not be sent.

              Names of the conntrack metrics to whitelist for monitoring. The metric value is in the file
              /${proc}/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_${metric_name}.
              By default the agent collects only max and count.
              Regex expressions for the project names are supported.
              Blacklist takes precedence over whitelist in case of overlap.

              Turn on collection of the AWS Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) statistics for network interfaces.

              This will only work on ENA-enabled instances, see:
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking-ena.html#ena-requirements

              Note that when running this check in container, it will return metrics for the container
              network interfaces. To get host-level ENA metrics from a container, it needs to be executed
              with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability and use the `host` network mode.

              Linux only.
              Enable collection of ethtool statistics for network interfaces.
              This will collect per queue and per cpu metrics depending on the driver.

              The queue and cpu will be used as a tag when submitting metrics.
              For example, 'queue_0_tx_cnt' will be submitted as 'system.net.ena.queue.tx_cnt' with tag 'queue:0'

              Currently supported drivers:
              - ena
              - virtio_net
              - hv_netvsc

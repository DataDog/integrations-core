            description: |
              Set to true to collect connection states for your interfaces
              Note: this will require either the command `ss` from system package `iproute2` or
              the command `netstat` from the system package `net-tools` to be installed
            value:

            description: |
              Set to true to enable connection queues collection
              Note: connection queues collections require both
              `collect_connection_state` and `collect_connection_queues` to be true
              because it also requires the command `ss` from system package `iproute2` or
              the command `netstat` from the system package `net-tools` to be installed
            value:

            description: |
              Set to false to not combine connection states.
              By default we combine states like fin_wait_1 and fin_wait_2
              together into one state: 'closing' disable this option to get more granular data.

            description: |
              By default, most metrics are submitted as rates.
              However, some metrics like tcp/udp retransmissions and errors are
              better handled as counts.
              Choose to disable rate metrics by setting collect_rate_metrics to false.
            value:
              example: true

              Choose to enable count metrics by setting collect_count_metrics to true.
              Count metrics have '.count' added to the metric name.

              Linux only.
              The location of the conntrack executable in order to get the stats from conntrack -S.
              It will be run with sudo by default, so an entry needs to be added to the sudoers file.
              By default, these metrics will not be sent.

            description: |
              Linux only.
              Names of the conntrack metrics to whitelist for monitoring. The metric value is in the file
              /${proc}/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_${metric_name}.
              By default the agent collects only max and count.
              Regex expressions for the project names are supported.
              Blacklist takes precedence over whitelist in case of overlap.
            value:
              example:
                - <METRIC_NAME>

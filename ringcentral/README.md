## Overview

The RingCentral integration seamlessly collects Voice, Audit, A2P SMS and Voice(Analytics) data and ingests them into Datadog for comprehensive analysis. Leveraging the built-in logs pipeline, these logs are parsed and enriched, enabling effortless search and analysis. The integration empowers users with deep insights into call activities, SMS trends, and audit trails through intuitive, out-of-the-box dashboards. Additionally, it includes pre-configured monitors for proactive notifications on SMS budget overrun and SMS error rates.

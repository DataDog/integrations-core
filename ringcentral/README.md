# RingCentral

## Overview
The RingCentral integration seamlessly collects Voice, Audit, A2P SMS, and Voice(Analytics) data and ingests them into Datadog for comprehensive analysis.

Additionally, it includes pre-configured monitors for proactive notifications on SMS budget overrun and SMS error rates.

### The integration collects:

- Voice

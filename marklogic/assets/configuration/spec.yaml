        Each filter in the list is composed of three parameters.
        'resource' is one of cluster/forest/database/host/server on which to apply the filter
        'type' is either whitelist (default) or blacklist. If a resource is both whitelisted and blacklisted it will be
               considered blacklisted.
        'name' is the resource name to match
        'id' is the resource id to match
        'group' is the resource group to match
        'metric_groups' is a list of type of metric_groups to collect.
                        Possible values are: `requests`, `status` and `storage`.
                        If not set, all groups of metrics are collected.

    ## VSPHERE EXAMPLE
    ## @param resource_filters - list of objects - optional - default: no filter
    ## Each filter in the list is composed of three parameters.
    ## 'resource' is one of vm/host/datastore/datacenter/cluster on which to apply the filter
    ## 'patterns' is a list of matching regex, if any of those matches, the resource will be monitored.
    ## 'type' is either whitelist (default) or blacklist. If a resource is both whitelisted and blacklisted it will be
    ##        considered blacklisted.
    ## 'property' is the kind of property on which to apply the filter and must be one of those values:
    ##    - name (default) to filter on the resource name (defined by vCenter)
    ##    - inventory_path to filter on the full inventory path
    ##      (ex: \/<Datacenter_name>\/vm\/<FOLDER_NAME>\/.* for all vms in the folder <FOLDER_NAME>)
    ##    - tag to filter only the resources with a given tag. Datadog has stricter rules (i.e no space), but the filter
    ##          is applied on the value coming from vCenter directly.
    ##    - hostname to filter on the ESXi Host name (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm')
    ##    - guest_hostname to filter on the VM hostname (only valid for if 'resource' equals 'vm' and
    ##      if VMware tools are installed)
    ## Note1: 'datastore', 'datacenter' and 'cluster' filters are ignored when collecting realtime metrics as those
    ##         resources do not have realtime metrics
    ## Note2: 'vm' and 'host' filters are ignored when collecting historical metrics as those resources do not have
    ##         historical metrics

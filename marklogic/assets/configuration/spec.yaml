        Each filter in the list is composed of two to four parameters.
        'resource_type' is one of forest/database/host/server on which to apply the filter (required)
        'pattern' is a pattern to match the resource name (required)
        'include' is whether or not the filter include (default) or exclude the specified resources.
              `True` (default) include the matching resources, and `False` exclude them.
              If a resource match both an exclude filter and an include filter, it will be considered excluded.
        'group' is the resource group to match (optional)

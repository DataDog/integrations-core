# SNMP Check

## Overview

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard for monitoring network-connected devices, such as routers, switches, servers, and firewalls. This check collects SNMP metrics from your network devices.

SNMP uses sysOIDs (System Object Identifiers) to uniquely identify devices, and OIDs (Object Identifiers) to uniquely identify managed objects. OIDs follow a hierarchical tree pattern: under the root is ISO which is numbered 1, then next level is ORG and numbered 3 and so on, with each level being separated by a `.`

A MIB (Management Information Base) acts as a translator between OIDs and human readable names, and organizes a subset of the hierarchy. Because of the way the tree is structured, most SNMP values start with the same set of objects: 1.3.6.1.1 for MIB-II which is a standard that holds system information like uptime, interfaces, network stack, and 1.3.6.1.4.1 which holds vendor specific information.

## Setup
### Installation

The SNMP check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package.

### Configuration

_Note: The following features are in beta._

Datadog's SNMP integration scans a provided subnet, auto discovers network devices and collects metrics using Datadog's sysOID mapped device profiles. Configuration for the integration check for the subnet to scan, snmp version to use, and profiles should ben defined in the `snmp.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2]. See the [sample snmp.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

#### Configuring Auto-Discovery

1. Install/upgrade the Datadog Agent to v6.16.

   You must be on v6.15+ of the Datadog Agent to enable this feature.

   If you already have a Datadog Agent installed, and would like to upgrade to Agent v6, a script is available to automatically install or upgrade to the new agent.

   For platform specific instructions, and more information about upgrading the Datadog Agent, see the Datadog docs

1. Configure the SNMP integration check with [snmp.d/conf.yaml][17] -- see samples included below. Define the following parameters in the yaml for the SNMP check:

  | Parameter Name | Definition | Is required for autodiscovery | Default value | Example |
  | --- |  --- | --- | --- | --- |  
  | `profiles` | The profiles you want the Datadog Agent to use. A profile is a collection of OIDs, the datadog Agent will poll and collect metrics and their associated tags from. A complete list of Datadog supported profiles can be found in the Datadog [integrations-core repo][18]. Profiles can either be referenced by file, under `definition_file`, or be written inline under `definition`. Any of the OOTB Datadog profiles can be listed by their name. If there are additional profiles that you already have written -- please let me know, weâ€™d love to add them to our open source repo -- can be referenced by the file path. Also note, the generic profile is currently listed as `generic_router.yaml`, but this should work for both routers, switches etc. | Yes | - | |
  | `network_address`| The subnet and mask the Agent will scan and discover devices on. Should be written in ipv4 notation. | Yes | - | `network_address:192.168.100.14/24`|
  | `community_string` | For use with SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 | No | | |
  | `snmp_version` | The SNMP version you are using.| No | 2 | |
  | `port` | The pot the Datadog agent will be listening on. | No | 161 | |
  | `timeout` | The number of seconds before timing out | No | 1 | | |
  | `retries` | The number of retries before failure. | No | 5 | |
  | `discovery_interval`| The interval between discovery scans. | No | 3600s | |
  | `discovery_allowed_failures` | The number of times a discovered host can fail before being removed from the list of discovered devices. | No | 3 | |
  | `bulk_threshold` | The number of symbols in a table that triggers a BULK request. this param is only relevant for SNMPv > 1. | No | 5 | |
  | `tags` | A list of global tags to add to every metric. Read more about [tagging in Datadog][19]. | No | - | `tags: - firewall` |

##### sysOID mapped device profiles

Profiles allow the SNMP check to reuse metric definitions across several device types, or instances. Profiles define metrics the same way as instances, either inline in the configuration file or in separate files. Each instance can only match a single profile. For example, you can define a profile in the `init_config` section:

```yaml
init_config:
  profiles:
    my-profile:
      definition:
        - MIB: IP-MIB
          table: ipSystemStatsTable
          symbols:
            - ipSystemStatsInReceives
          metric_tags:
            - tag: ipversion
          index: 1
      sysobjectid: '1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.10'
```

Then either reference it explicitly by name, or use sysObjectID detection:

```
yaml
instances:
   - ip_address: 192.168.34.10
     profile: my-profile
   - ip_address: 192.168.34.11
     # Don't need anything else here, the check will query the sysObjectID
     # and use the profile if it matches.
```

If necessary, additional metrics can be defined in the instances. These metrics are collected alongside those in the profile

#### Metric definition by Profile
Profiles can be used interchangeably, such that devices that share MIB dependencies can reuse the same profiles. For example, the Cisco c3850 profile can be used across many Cisco Switches.

Please note: Profiles currently require there to a local version of the MIBs referenced.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][12] and look for `snmp` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

The SNMP check submits specified metrics under the `snmp.*` namespace.

### Events

The SNMP check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

**snmp.can_check**:<br>
Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent cannot collect SNMP metrics, otherwise returns `OK`.

## Troubleshooting

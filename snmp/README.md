# SNMP Check

## Overview

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard for monitoring network-connected devices, such as routers, switches, servers, and firewalls. This check collects SNMP metrics from your network devices.

SNMP uses sysOIDs (System Object Identifiers) to uniquely identify devices, and OIDs (Object Identifiers) to uniquely identify managed objects. OIDs follow a hierarchical tree pattern: under the root is ISO, which is numbered 1. The next level is ORG and numbered 3 and so on, with each level being separated by a `.`.

A MIB (Management Information Base) acts as a translator between OIDs and human readable names, and organizes a subset of the hierarchy. Because of the way the tree is structured, most SNMP values start with the same set of objects:

* `1.3.6.1.1`: (MIB-II) A standard that holds system information like uptime, interfaces, and network stack.
* `1.3.6.1.4.1`: A standard that holds vendor specific information.

## Setup

### Installation

The SNMP check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package. No additional installation is necessary.

### Configuration

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<b>Note</b>: The following features are in beta.
</div>

The Datadog SNMP check auto-discovers network devices on a provided subnet, and collects metrics using Datadog's sysOID mapped device profiles.

Edit the subnet, SNMP version, and profiles in the `snmp.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2]. See the [sample snmp.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

#### Autodiscovery

To use Autodiscovery with the SNMP check:

1. Install or upgrade the Datadog Agent to v6.16+. For platform specific instructions, see the [Datadog Agent][4] documentation.

2. Configure the SNMP check with [snmp.d/conf.yaml][3]. The following parameters are available. See the [sample config](#sample-config) for required parameters, default values, and examples.

| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `profiles`                   | A list of profiles to use. A profile is a collection of OIDs the Datadog Agent collects metrics and associated tags from. A complete list of Datadog supported profiles can be found in [Github][5]. Profiles can be referenced by file, under `definition_file`, or written inline under `definition`. Any of the OOTB Datadog profiles can be listed by their name. Additional custom profiles can be referenced by the file path. **Note**: The generic profile is `generic_router.yaml`, which should work for routers, switches, etc. |
| `network_address`            | The subnet and mask written in IPv4 notation for the Agent to scan and discover devices on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

##### sysOID mapped device profiles

Profiles allow the SNMP check to reuse metric definitions across several device types or instances. Profiles define metrics the same way as instances, either inline in the configuration file or in separate files. Each instance can only match a single profile. For example, you can define a profile in the `init_config` section:

```yaml
init_config:
  profiles:
    my-profile:
      definition:
        - MIB: IP-MIB
          table: ipSystemStatsTable
          symbols:
            - ipSystemStatsInReceives
          metric_tags:
            - tag: ipversion
          index: 1
      sysobjectid: '1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.10'
```

Then either reference it explicitly by name, or use sysObjectID detection:

```yaml
instances:
   - ip_address: 192.168.34.10
     profile: my-profile
   - ip_address: 192.168.34.11
     # Don't need anything else here, the check will query the sysObjectID
     # and use the profile if it matches.
```

If necessary, additional metrics can be defined in the instances. These metrics are collected in addition to those in the profile.

#### Metric definition by profile

Profiles can be used interchangeably, such that devices that share MIB dependencies can reuse the same profiles. For example, the Cisco c3850 profile can be used across many Cisco switches.

* [Generic router](#generic-router-profile)
* [F5 Big IP](#f5-big-ip-profile)
* [Dell iDRAC](#dell-idrac-profile)
* [Cisco Nexus](#cisco-nexus-profile)
* [Cisco c3850](#cisco-c3850-device-profile)
* [Cisco Meraki](#cisco-meraki-profile)

##### Generic router profile

The [generic router profile][7] collects the following metrics.

| Metric                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Tags                     |

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][10] and look for `snmp` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

The SNMP check submits specified metrics under the `snmp.*` namespace.

### Events

The SNMP check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

**snmp.can_check**:<br>
Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent cannot collect SNMP metrics, otherwise returns `OK`.

# PgBouncer check

## Overview

The PgBouncer check tracks connection pool metrics and lets you monitor traffic to and from your application.

## Setup
### Installation

The PgBouncer check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your PgBouncer nodes.  

If you need the newest version of the PgBouncer check, install the `dd-check-pgbouncer` package; this package's check overrides the one packaged with the Agent. See the [integrations-core](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core#installing-the-integrations) repository for more details.

### Configuration

Create a file `pgbouncer.yaml` in the Agent's `conf.d` directory. See the [sample pgbouncer.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/pgbouncer/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options:

```
init_config:

instances:
  - host: localhost
    port: 15433
    username: <YOUR_USERNAME>
    password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
#   tags:
#     - env:prod
  - database_url: postgresql://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASS>@<DB_HOST>:<DB_PORT>/dbname?sslmode=require
#   tags:
#     - role:main
```

In your PGBouncer userlist.txt file add
```
  "datadog" "<your_pass>"
```

Next, in your PGBouncer pgbouncer.ini file add
```
stats_users = datadog
```

[Restart the Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent) to start sending PgBouncer metrics to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/) and look for `pgbouncer` under the Checks section:

```

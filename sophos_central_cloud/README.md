# Sophos Central Cloud

## Overview

[Sophos Central][1] is a unified, cloud-based management platform to monitor and secure your organization from threats. It's used by businesses of all sizes to consolidate the Sophos suite of solutions into a single management solution.

This integration ingests the following logs:

- Alert: Represents a notification or warning generated by Sophos Central Cloud in response to a security event or potential threat. Alerts are triggered based on predefined security policies, detection rules, or anomalous activities identified by the Sophos Central Cloud.
- Event: Represents a specific occurrence that is detected and recorded by Sophos Central Cloud. Events can include various security-related activities such as malware detection, unauthorized access attempts, system vulnerabilities, and other security events.

The Sophos Central Cloud integration seamlessly collects all the above listed logs, channeling them into Datadog for analysis. Leveraging the built-in logs pipeline, these logs are parsed and enriched, enabling effortless search and analysis. The integration provides insight into alerts and events through the out-of-the-box dashboards. Additionally, the integration enriches corresponding endpoint details along with alert and event logs through the **get_endpoint_details** flag.

# Agent Check: SAP HANA

## Overview

This check monitors [SAP HANA][1] 2.0, SPS 2 through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

### Installation

The SAP HANA check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package. To use this integration, you need to manually install the [hdbcli][10] library.


For Unix:

```text
sudo -Hu dd-agent /opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/pip install hdbcli==2.21.28
```

For Windows:

```text
"C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\embedded<PYTHON_MAJOR_VERSION>\python.exe" -m pip install hdbcli==2.21.28
```

#### Prepare HANA

To query certain views, specific privileges must be granted to the chosen HANA monitoring user. For more information, see [Granting privileges](#granting-privileges).

To learn how to set the port number for HANA tenant, single-tenant, and system databases, see the [Connect to SAP documentation][3].

##### User creation

1. Connect to the system database and run the following command to create a user:

   ```shell
   CREATE RESTRICTED USER <USER> PASSWORD <PASSWORD>;
   ```

2. Run the following command to allow the user to connect to the system:

   ```shell
   ALTER USER <USER> ENABLE CLIENT CONNECT;
   ```

3. (optional) To avoid service interruption you may want to make the password long-lived:

   ```shell
   ALTER USER <USER> DISABLE PASSWORD LIFETIME;
   ```

##### Granting privileges

1. Run the following command to create a monitoring role (named `DD_MONITOR` for these examples):

   ```shell
   CREATE ROLE DD_MONITOR;
   ```

2. Run the following command to grant read-only access to all system views:

   ```shell
   GRANT CATALOG READ TO DD_MONITOR;
   ```

3. Then run the following commands to grant select privileges on each system view:

   ```shell
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_DATABASE TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_DATABASES TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_BACKUP_PROGRESS TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_CONNECTIONS TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_DISK_USAGE TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_LICENSES TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_RS_MEMORY TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_SERVICE_COMPONENT_MEMORY TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_SERVICE_MEMORY TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_SERVICE_STATISTICS TO DD_MONITOR;
   GRANT SELECT ON SYS_DATABASES.M_VOLUME_IO_TOTAL_STATISTICS TO DD_MONITOR;
   ```

4. Finally, run the following command to assign the monitoring role to the desired user:

   ```shell
   GRANT DD_MONITOR TO <USER>;
   ```

### Configuration

1. Edit the `sap_hana.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your sap_hana performance data. See the [sample sap_hana.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

#### Log collection

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. Enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `sap_hana.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your SAP HANA logs, adjusting the `service` value to configure them for your environment:

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: integration
       source: sap_hana
       service: sap_hana
   ```

    See the [sample sap_hana.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

3. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `sap_hana` under the Checks section.

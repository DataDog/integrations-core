# Nfsstat Integration

## Overview

nfsiostat-sysstat is a tool that gets metrics from NFS mounts. This check grabs these metrics.

## Setup
### Installation

Install the `dd-check-nfsstat` package manually or with your favorite configuration manager

### Configuration

Edit the `nfsstat.yaml` file to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor

### Validation

When you run `datadog-agent info` you should see something like the following:

    Checks

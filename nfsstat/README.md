# Nfsstat Integration

## Overview

The NFS integration collects metrics about mount points on the NFS client as it uses the `nfsiostat` tool that displays NFS client per-mount [statistics][1].

## Setup
### Installation

The NFSstat check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `nfsstat.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][3], to point to your nfsiostat binary script, or use the one included with the binary installer. See the [sample nfsstat.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][5] and look for `nfsstat` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics
See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Events
The Nfststat check does not include any events.

### Service Checks
The Nfsstat check does not include any service checks.

        The URL where elasticsearch accepts HTTP requests. This is used to

      description: |
        If each machine only runs a single Elasticsearch node per cluster, you
        want to set each Elasticsearch `node.name` to the machine hostname. You may
        then set `node_name_as_host` to `true` to avoid duplicate hostnames.
        See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/node.name.html

      description: |
        If your cluster is hosted externally (i.e., you're not pointing to localhost)
        you must to set `cluster_stats` to true otherwise the check only
        submits metrics of the local node.
        This parameter was also called `is_external` and you can still use it but it
        is removed in Agent version 6+.

    - name: detailed_index_stats
      description: |
        If you want to obtain index-specific stats, use this flag with `cluster_stats` and `pshard_stats` set to true.
        Without this flag you only get stats from `_all`.
        Do not use it if you are pointing to localhost.
      value:
        type: boolean

    - name: index_stats

        example: false
    - name: pshard_stats
      description: |
        If you enable the "pshard_stats" flag, statistics over primary shards
        are collected by the check and sent to the backend with the
        'elasticsearch.primary' prefix. It is particularly useful if you want to
        get certain metrics without taking replicas into account. For instance,
        'elasticsearch.primaries.docs.count` gives you the total number of
        documents in your indexes WITHOUT counting duplicates due to the existence
        of replica shards in your ES cluster.

        Some managed ElasticSearch services (e.g. AWS ElasticSearch) do not expose this endpoint.
        Set `pending_task_stats` to false if you use such a service.

    - name: custom_queries
      description: |
        Run custom queries for Elasticsearch. Each custom query endpoint can collect multiple metrics and tags.
        Note: Each custom query requires an `endpoint`, `data_path`, and `columns` parameter. Each `columns` parameter
        should have at least one value containing `name` and `value_path`.

        Each query can have the following parameters:

        1. endpoint - The Elasticsearch API endpoint to query.

        2. data_path - The JSON path up to, but not including, the metric. For example, if querying for size of parent
                       circuit breaker, the full path is 'breakers.parent.estimated_size_in_bytes', which means the
                       `data_path` is 'breakers.parent'. `data_path` cannot contain any wildcards, so accessing data
                       indexed by ID (such as node or index) is not possible.

        3. columns - The list representing the data to be collected from the JSON query. There are two required pieces
                     of data:
                       a. value_path - This is the JSON path from the `data_path` to the metric. This path may include
                                       string keys as well as list indices. For example, if querying for size of parent
                                       circuit breaker, the `value_path` is `estimated_size_in_bytes`.
                       b. name - The full metric name sent to Datadog. If `type` is `tag`, this column is considered a
                                 tag and applied to every metric collected by this particular query.

                       c. type (optional) - An optional parameter to designates the type of data sent. Possible values
                                            for `type` include `gauge`, `monotonic_count`, `rate`, and `tag`, with
                                            `gauge` being the default.

        4. payload (optional) - An optional payload can be included when querying the endpoint. This turns the GET
                                request into a POST request, so a read-only user should be used when writing
                                custom queries with a payload. Use YAML formatting when including a payload.

        Example:
        - endpoint: /_search
          data_path: aggregations.genres.buckets
          payload:
            aggs:
              genres:
                terms:
                  field: "id"
          columns:
          - value_path: key
            name: id
            type: tag
          - value_path: doc_count
            name: elasticsearch.doc_count
          tags:
          - custom_tag:1

        By default we submit events to Datadog if the cluster starts unhealthy or anytime its health changes.

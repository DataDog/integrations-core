        The URL where elasticsearch accepts HTTP requests. This is used to
        fetch statistics from the nodes and information about the cluster health.

    - name: node_name_as_host
      description: |
        If each machine only runs a single Elasticsearch node per cluster, you
        want to set each Elasticsearch `node.name` to the machine hostname. You may
        then set `node_name_as_host` to `true` to avoid duplicate hostnames.
        See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/node.name.html

    - name: cluster_stats
      description: |
        If your cluster is hosted externally (i.e., you're not pointing to localhost)
        you must to set `cluster_stats` to true otherwise the check only
        submits metrics of the local node.
        This parameter was also called `is_external` and you can still use it but it
        is removed in Agent version 6+.

        type: boolean
        example: false
    - name: index_stats
      description: Set "index_stats" to true to collect metrics for individual indices.
      value:
        type: boolean
        example: false
    - name: pshard_stats
      description: |
        If you enable the "pshard_stats" flag, statistics over primary shards
        are collected by the check and sent to the backend with the
        'elasticsearch.primary' prefix. It is particularly useful if you want to
        get certain metrics without taking replicas into account. For instance,
        'elasticsearch.primaries.docs.count` gives you the total number of
        documents in your indexes WITHOUT counting duplicates due to the existence
        of replica shards in your ES cluster.

        type: boolean

    - name: slm_stats
      description: | 
        Set "slm_stats" to true to collect statistics about Snapshot Lifcycle Management.
        The user must have `manage_slm` cluster privilege to get these metrics.

        It specifies whether to collect data exposed by the `pending_tasks` cluster endpoint.
        Ref: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-pending.html
        Some managed ElasticSearch services (e.g. AWS ElasticSearch) do not expose this endpoint.
        Set `pending_task_stats` to false if you use such a service.

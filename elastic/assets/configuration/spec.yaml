        The URL where elasticsearch accepts HTTP requests. This is used to

      description: |
        If each machine only runs a single Elasticsearch node per cluster, you
        want to set each Elasticsearch `node.name` to the machine hostname. You may
        then set `node_name_as_host` to `true` to avoid duplicate hostnames.
        See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/node.name.html

      description: |
        If your cluster is hosted externally (i.e., you're not pointing to localhost)
        you must to set `cluster_stats` to true otherwise the check only
        submits metrics of the local node.
        This parameter was also called `is_external` and you can still use it but it
        is removed in Agent version 6+.
      value:
        type: boolean
        default: false

    - name: index_stats
      description: Set "index_stats" to true to collect metrics for individual indices.

    - name: pshard_stats
      description: |
        If you enable the "pshard_stats" flag, statistics over primary shards
        are collected by the check and sent to the backend with the
        'elasticsearch.primary' prefix. It is particularly useful if you want to
        get certain metrics without taking replicas into account. For instance,
        'elasticsearch.primaries.docs.count` gives you the total number of
        documents in your indexes WITHOUT counting duplicates due to the existence
        of replica shards in your ES cluster.
      value:
        type: boolean
        default: false

        It specifies whether to collect data exposed by the `pending_tasks` cluster endpoint.
        Ref: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-pending.html
        Some managed ElasticSearch services (e.g. AWS ElasticSearch) do not expose this endpoint.
        Set `pending_task_stats` to false if you use such a service.

        It is used to signify a URL that includes a context root
        needed for a forwarder application to access Elasticsearch REST services for example

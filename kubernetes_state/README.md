# Kubernetes_state Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from kubernetes_state service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor kubernetes_state states
* Be notified about kubernetes_state failovers and events.

## Setup
### Installation

The Kubernetes-Sate check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your Kubernetes servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `kubernetes_state.yaml` file to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor. See the [sample kubernetes_state.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/kubernetes_state/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/) and look for `kubernetes_state` under the Checks section:

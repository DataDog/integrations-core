# Kubernetes_state Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from kubernetes_state service in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor kubernetes_state states
- Be notified about kubernetes_state failovers and events.

## Setup

### Installation

The Kubernetes-State check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your Kubernetes servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `kubernetes_state.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2]. See the [sample kubernetes_state.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][4] and look for `kubernetes_state` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][5] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The Kubernetes-state check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

See [../kubernetes/assets/service_checks.json][6] for a list of service checks provided by this integration.

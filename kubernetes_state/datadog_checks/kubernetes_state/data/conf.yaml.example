  # To enable Kube State metrics you must specify the url exposing the API
  #
  # Note for RHEL and SUSE users: due to compatibility issues, the check does not make use of
  # the CPP extension to process Protocol buffer messages coming from the api. Depending
  # on the metrics volume, the check may run very slowly.
  - kube_state_url: http://example.com:8080/metrics
    # Tags are reported as set by kube-state-metrics. If you want to translate
    # them to other tags, you can use the labels_mapper dictionary
    # labels_mapper:
    #   namespace: kube_namespace
    #
    # Add the tags to join from the KSM.
    # Example: Joining for deployment metrics. Based on: kube_deployment_labels{deployment="kube-dns",label_addonmanager_kubernetes_io_mode="Reconcile"}
    # Use the following config to add the value of label_addonmanager_kubernetes_io_mode as a tag to your KSM deployment metrics.
    # label_joins:
    #  kube_deployment_labels:
    #    label_to_match: deployment
    #    labels_to_get:
    #      - label_addonmanager_kubernetes_io_mode
    #
    # By default the hostname for metrics containing the node label will be
    # overriden by the value of the label, this can be deactivated (all metrics
    # will be attached to the host running KSM)
    # hostname_override: true
    #
    # Send (deprecated) pod.phase service checks (default true, will be turned off in future versions)
    # We recommend using the corresponding gauges instead, which benefit from historical data unlike service checks
    # send_pod_phase_service_checks: false

    # You can also specify here custom tags to be added to all metrics reported by this integration
    #  tags:
    #    - optional_tag1
    #    - optional_tag2

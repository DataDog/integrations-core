## Overview

[Cisco Secure Endpoint][1] is a single-agent solution that provides comprehensive protection, detection, response, and user access coverage to defend against threats to your endpoints. Cisco Secure Endpoint can detect and neutralize malicious activity in real time, ensuring robust protection of your digital assets.

This integration ingests the following logs:
- Audit: Audit logs provide activities performed by a user in the Cisco Secure Endpoint console.
- Event: Event logs are essential for tracking security events, enabling quick detection, response, and analysis of potential threats.

The Cisco Secure Endpoint integration provides out-of-the-box dashboards so you can gain insights into the Cisco Secure Endpoint's audit and event logs, enabling quick and necessary actions. Additionally, out-of-the-box detection rules are available to help you monitor and respond to potential security threats effectively.

**Disclaimer**: Your use of this integration, which may collect data that includes personal information, is subject to your agreements with Datadog. Cisco is not responsible for the privacy, security or integrity of any end-user information, including personal data, transmitted through your use of the integration.

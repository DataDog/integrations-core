# Agent Check: Openstack Controller

## Overview

**Note**: This integration only applies to OpenStack v13+ (containerized OpenStack). If you are looking to collect metrics from OpenStack v12 and below (non-containerized OpenStack), use the [OpenStack integration][8].

This check monitors [OpenStack][1] from the controller node.

## Setup

### Installation

The OpenStack Controller check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you do not need to install anything else on your server.

### Configuration

The OpenStack Controller integration is designed to collect information from all compute nodes and the servers running it. The integration should be run from a single Agent to monitor your OpenStack environment, and can be deployed on your controller node or an adjacent server that has access to the Keystone and Nova endpoints.

#### Prepare OpenStack

Create a `datadog` user that is used in your `openstack_controller.d/conf.yaml` file. This user requires admin read-only permissions across your environment so that it can be run from a single node and read high level system information about all nodes and servers.

#### Agent configuration

1. Edit the `openstack_controller.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your OpenStack Controller performance data. See the [sample openstack_controller.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options:

   ```yaml
   init_config:

   instances:
     ## @param name - string - required
     ## Unique identifier for this instance.
     #
     - name: "<INSTANCE_NAME>"

       ## @param user - object - required
       ## Password authentication is the only auth method supported
       ## User expects username, password, and user domain id
       ## `user` should resolve to a structure like
       ## {'password': '<PASSWORD>', 'name': '<USER_NAME>', 'domain': {'id': '<DOMAIN_ID>'}}
       ## The check uses the Unscoped token method to collect information about
       ## all available projects to the user.
       #
       user:
         password: "<PASSWORD>"
         name: "<USER_NAME>"
         domain:
           id: "<DOMAIN_ID>"
   ```

2. [Restart the Agent][3]

##### Log collection

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, you can enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `openstack_controller.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Openstack logs:

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: file
       path: "<LOG_FILE_PATH>"
       source: openstack
   ```

    Change the `path` parameter value and configure them for your environment. See the [sample openstack_controller.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.
   

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `openstack_controller` under the Checks section.

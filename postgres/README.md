# PostgreSQL Integration

![PostgreSQL Graph][1]

## Overview

Get metrics from PostgreSQL in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor PostgreSQL states.
- Received notifications about PostgreSQL failovers and events.

## Setup

### Installation

The PostgreSQL check is packaged with the Agent. To start gathering your PostgreSQL metrics and logs, [install the Agent][2].

### Configuration

#### Prepare Postgres

To get started with the PostgreSQL integration, create a read-only `datadog` user with proper access to your PostgreSQL server. Start `psql` on your PostgreSQL database.

For PostgreSQL version 10 and above, run:

```shell
create user datadog with password '<PASSWORD>';
grant pg_monitor to datadog;
```

For older PostgreSQL versions, run:

```shell
create user datadog with password '<PASSWORD>';
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_database to datadog;
```

**Note**: When generating custom metrics that require querying additional tables, you may need to grant the `CONNECT` permission on those tables to the `datadog` user.

To verify the permissions are correct, run the following command:

```shell
psql -h localhost -U datadog postgres -c \
"select * from pg_stat_database LIMIT(1);" \
&& echo -e "\e[0;32mPostgres connection - OK\e[0m" \
|| echo -e "\e[0;31mCannot connect to Postgres\e[0m"
```

When it prompts for a password, enter the one used in the first command.

**Note**: For PostgreSQL versions 9.6 and below, run the following and create a `SECURITY DEFINER` to read from `pg_stat_activity`.

```shell
CREATE FUNCTION pg_stat_activity() RETURNS SETOF pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity AS
$$ SELECT * from pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity; $$
LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE VIEW pg_stat_activity_dd AS SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity();
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_activity_dd to datadog;
```

#### Host

Follow the instructions below to configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Containerized](#containerized) section.

##### Metric collection

1. Edit the `postgres.d/conf.yaml` file to point to your `host` / `port` and set the masters to monitor. See the [sample postgres.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

   ```yaml
   init_config:

   instances:
     ## @param host - string - required
     ## The hostname to connect to.
     ## NOTE: Even if the server name is "localhost", the agent connects to
     ## PostgreSQL using TCP/IP, unless you also provide a value for the sock key.
     ## If `use_psycopg2` is enabled, use the directory containing
     ## the UNIX socket (ex: `/run/postgresql/`) otherwise, use the full path to
     ##  the socket file (ex: `/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5433`).
     #
     - host: localhost

       ## @param port - integer - required
       ## Port to use when connecting to PostgreSQL.
       #
       port: 5432

       ## @param user - string - required
       ## Datadog Username created to connect to PostgreSQL.
       #
       username: datadog

       ## @param pass - string - required
       ## Password associated with the Datadog user.
       #
       password: "<PASSWORD>"
   ```

2. [Restart the Agent][4].

##### Log collection

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

PostgreSQL default logging is to `stderr`, and logs do not include detailed information. It is recommended to log into a file with additional details specified in the log line prefix. Refer to the PostgreSQL [documentation][14] on this topic for additional details.

1. Logging is configured within the file `/etc/postgresql/<VERSION>/main/postgresql.conf`. For regular log results, including statement outputs, uncomment the following parameters in the log section:

   ```conf
     logging_collector = on
     log_directory = 'pg_log'  # directory where log files are written,
                               # can be absolute or relative to PGDATA
     log_filename = 'pg.log'   # log file name, can include pattern
     log_statement = 'all'     # log all queries
     #log_duration = on
     log_line_prefix= '%m [%p] %d %a %u %h %c '
     log_file_mode = 0644
     ## For Windows
     #log_destination = 'eventlog'
   ```

2. To gather detailed duration metrics and make them searchable in the Datadog interface, they should be configured inline with the statement themselves. See below for the recommended configuration differences from above and note that both `log_statement` and `log_duration` options are commented out. See discussion on this topic [here][15].

    This config logs all statements, but to reduce the output to those which have a certain duration, set the `log_min_duration_statement` value to the desired minimum duration (in milliseconds):

   ```conf
     log_min_duration_statement = 0    # -1 is disabled, 0 logs all statements
                                       # and their durations, > 0 logs only
                                       # statements running at least this number
                                       # of milliseconds
     #log_statement = 'all'
     #log_duration = on
   ```

3. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, enable it in your `datadog.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

4. Add and edit this configuration block to your `postgres.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your PostgreSQL logs:

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: file
       path: "<LOG_FILE_PATH>"
       source: postgresql
       sourcecategory: database
       service: "<SERVICE_NAME>"
       #To handle multi line that starts with yyyy-mm-dd use the following pattern
       #log_processing_rules:
       #  - type: multi_line
       #    pattern: \d{4}\-(0?[1-9]|1[012])\-(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])
       #    name: new_log_start_with_date
   ```

      Change the `service` and `path` parameter values to configure for your environment. See the [sample postgres.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

5. [Restart the Agent][4].

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][5] for guidance on applying the parameters below.

##### Metric collection

| Parameter            | Value                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` | `postgres`                                                                      |
| `<INIT_CONFIG>`      | blank or `{}`                                                                   |
| `<INSTANCE_CONFIG>`  | `{"host":"%%host%%", "port":5432,"username":"datadog","password":"<PASSWORD>"}` |

##### Log collection

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. To enable it, see [Docker log collection documentation][6].

| Parameter      | Value                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `<LOG_CONFIG>` | `{"source": "postgresql", "service": "postgresql"}` |

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `postgres` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

Some of the metrics listed below require additional configuration, see the [sample postgres.d/conf.yaml][3] for all configurable options.

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][8] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The PostgreSQL check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

**postgres.can_connect**:<br>
Returns `CRITICAL` if the Agent is unable to connect to the monitored PostgreSQL instance, otherwise returns `OK`.

Send database instance metdata prior to check queries. This prevents a scenario where exceptions thrown during check execution can cause the database_instance resource to not be emitted. When the resource is not emitted, this can cause flapping in host tags. For example, a customer might see dbms:N/A for a period of time until a new database_instance resource is created. Moving this means it will always be sent, even if an unexepected exception is thrown during check execution.

This un-reverts https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/pull/17187, which was reverted due to a flaw in the logic that could result in improper metric counts. The fixed version caches an initial state of pg_stat_statements and updates it with incremental partial query data. This allows the agent to only fetch full rows for queries that were called between check runs, while also accounting for queryids that can map to the same query_signature.

        The hostname to connect to.
        NOTE: Even if the server name is `localhost`, the Agent connects to PostgreSQL using TCP/IP unless you also
        provide a value for the sock key.
        If `use_psycopg2` is enabled, use the directory containing the UNIX socket (ex: `/run/postgresql/`)
        otherwise, use the full path to the socket file (ex: `/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5433`).

    - name: ssl
      description: |
        This option determines whether or not and with what priority a secure SSL TCP/IP connection
        is negotiated with the server. There are six modes:
        - `disable`: Only tries a non-SSL connection.
        - `allow`: First tries a non-SSL connection; if if fails, tries an SSL connection.
        - `prefer`: First tries an SSL connection; if it fails, tries a non-SSL connection.
        - `require`: Only tries an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verifies the certificate in
                     the same way as if verify-ca was specified.
        - `verify-ca`: Only tries an SSL connection, and verifies that the server certificate is issued by a
                       trusted certificate authority (CA).
        - `verify-full`: Only tries an SSL connection and verifies that the server certificate is issued by a
                         trusted CA and that the requested server host name matches the one in the certificate.

        For a detailed description of how these options work see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html

        Note: `true` is an alias for `require`, and `false` is an alias for `disable`

    - name: relations
      description: |
        The list of relations/tables must be specified here to track per-relation (table) metrics.
        If enabled, `dbname` should be specified to collect database-specific relations metrics.
        You can either specify a single relation by its exact name in 'relation_name' or use a regex to track metrics
        from all matching relations (useful in cases where relation names are dynamically generated, e.g. TimescaleDB).
        Each relation generates many metrics (10 + 10 per index)
        By default all schemas are included. To track relations from specific schemas only,
        you can specify the `schemas` attribute and provide a list of schemas to use for filtering.

        Note: For compatibility reasons you can also use the following syntax to track relations metrics by specifying
        the list of table names. All schemas are included and regex are not supported.
        relations:
          - <TABLE_NAME1>
          - <TABLE_NAME2>

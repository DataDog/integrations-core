## Overview

[Obsidian Security][1] is a SaaS security platform that unifies visibility, governance, compliance, and threat defense for critical business applications. It helps organizations protect sensitive data, minimize risk, and streamline management across their SaaS environment.

This integration ingests the following logs:

- **Audit Logs**: Audit logs provide detailed records of user and administrative activities within the Obsidian platform for transparency, compliance, and investigation.
- **Alerts**: Alerts logs highlight risks and threats identified by Obsidian Security using machine learning, expert rules, and other detection methods.
- **Events**: Event logs capture activities occurring within cloud services, showing which actors performed actions and which targets were affected.

Integrate Obsidian Security with Datadog to gain insights into audit, alerts, and event logs using pre-built dashboard visualizations. Datadog uses its built-in log pipelines to parse and enrich these logs, facilitating easy search and detailed insights. Additionally, the integration can be used with Cloud SIEM detection rules for enhanced monitoring and security.

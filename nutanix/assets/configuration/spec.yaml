              The IP address or FQDN of the Prism Central.
              This is required to connect to your Nutanix Prism Central instance.

              You can optionally include the port in this field (e.g., 'prism-central.example.com:9440').
              If a port is specified here, do not set the pc_port option, as this will cause a configuration error.
            required: true

            description: |
              The port of the Prism Central API.
              Default is 9440 for HTTPS.

              Note: If you include the port in the pc_ip field (e.g., 'prism-central.example.com:9440'),
              do not set this option as it will cause a configuration error.

          - name: page_limit
            description: |
              The maximum number of items to retrieve per page when making paginated API requests.
              This controls the page size for API calls to Prism Central.
              Default is 50. Increase this value to reduce the number of API calls for large environments.

            description: |
              The initial backoff duration in seconds when retrying rate-limited requests.
              The actual backoff time uses exponential backoff: base * (2 ^ attempt) + jitter.

            value:
              type: number

            description: |
              The maximum backoff duration in seconds when retrying rate-limited requests.
              This caps the exponential backoff calculation to prevent excessive wait times.
              Default is 30 seconds.
            value:

# Agent Metrics Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from the Agent Metrics service in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor `agent_metrics` states.
- Be notified about `agent_metrics` failovers and events.

**NOTE**: The Agent Metrics check has been rewritten in Go for Agent v6 to take advantage of the new internal architecture. Hence it is still maintained but **only works with Agents prior to major version 6**.

To collect Agent metrics for Agent v6+, use the [Go-expvar check][1] with [the `agent_stats.yaml` configuration file][2] packaged with the Agent.

## Setup

### Installation

The Agent Metrics check is included in the [Datadog Agent][3] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `agent_metrics.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][4], to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor. See the [sample agent_metrics.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][6].

#### Metrics collection

The Agent Metrics integration can potentially emit [custom metrics][7], which may impact your [billing][8].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][9] and look for `agent_metrics` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

All data collected are only available for Agent v5.

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][10] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The Agent Metrics check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

The Agent Metrics check does not include any service checks.

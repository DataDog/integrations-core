              The Cacti checks requires access to the Cacti DB in MySQL and to the RRD
              files that contain the metrics tracked in Cacti.
              In almost all cases, you'll only need one instance pointing to the Cacti
              database.
              The `rrd_path` will probably be `/var/lib/cacti/rra` on Ubuntu
              or `/var/www/html/cacti/rra` on any other machines.

              example: <CACTI_RRA_PATH>

          - name: field_names
            description: |
              The `field_names` specifies which field_names should be used
              to determine if a device is a real device. You can let it commented
              out as the default values should satisfy your needs.
              You can run the following query to determine your field names:
                    SELECT
                         h.hostname as hostname,
                         hsc.field_value as device_name,
                         dt.data_source_path as rrd_path,
                         hsc.field_name as field_name
                     FROM data_local dl
                         JOIN host h on dl.host_id = h.id
                         JOIN data_template_data dt on dt.local_data_id = dl.id
                         LEFT JOIN host_snmp_cache hsc on h.id = hsc.host_id
                             AND dl.snmp_index = hsc.snmp_index
                     WHERE dt.data_source_path IS NOT NULL
                     AND dt.data_source_path != ''
            value:
              example:
                - ifName
                - dskDevice
                - ifIndex
              type: array
              items:
                type: string
          - name: rrd_whitelist
            description: |
              The `rrd_whitelist` is a path to a text file that has a list of file patterns,
              one per line, that should be fetched. If no whitelist is specified, all
              metrics are fetched.
            value:
              example: <RRD_WHITELIST_FILE_PATH>

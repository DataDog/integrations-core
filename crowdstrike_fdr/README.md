# CrowdStrike FDR

## Overview

[CrowdStrike Falcon Data Replicator (FDR)][1] is a high-fidelity data export solution that enables organizations to securely stream raw endpoint telemetry in near real time. FDR delivers detailed event data through a data feed in JSON format using Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

Integrate CrowdStrike FDR with Datadog to gain insights into Authentication & Identity, Account & Privilege Changes, Execution Monitoring & Threat Detection, File & Malware Activity and Network Behavior events using pre-built dashboard visualizations. Datadog leverages its built-in log pipelines to parse and enrich these logs, facilitating easy search, and detailed insights. Additionally, the integration includes ready-to-use Cloud SIEM detection rules for enhanced monitoring and security.

## Setup

### Set up data replication from CrowdStrike FDR to a customer-owned S3 bucket

#### Setup a custom AWS S3 bucket
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon S3.
2. Provide the details as mentioned below:
   - **Bucket name**: Enter a Bucket name (must be globally unique and begins with the prefix `crowdstrike-fdr` to comply with integration naming requirements).
   - **AWS Region**: Choose a region.
      - You can only use your S3 bucket if you're using the US-1, US-2, or EU-1 CrowdStrike clouds.
      - Ensure that your bucket resides in the same AWS region as your Falcon CID.
        CrowdStrike terminology for cloud regions differs slightly from AWS, as shown in this table.
        | CrowdStrike region | AWS region   |
        |--------------------|--------------|
        | US-1               | us-west-1    |
        | US-2               | us-west-2    |
        | EU-1               | eu-central-1 |

        For example, if your Falcon CID resides in US-1, the bucket must reside in AWS's us-west-1 region.
3. Click **Create bucket**.
4. Once the bucket is created, click on the newly created bucket.
5. Go to the **Permissions** tab.
6. Click **Bucket policy** > **Edit**.
7. Replace the 2 occurrences of the **<bucket_name>** placeholder in the below policy statement with your own bucket's name and add it in the **Policy** section: 
    ```
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "Allow cs ls",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::292230061137:root"
          },
          "Action": [
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:GetBucketLocation"
          ],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>"
        },
        {
          "Sid": "allow cs all",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::292230061137:root"
          },
          "Action": "s3:*",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
8. Copy the **Bucket ARN** of your S3 bucket.
9. Click **Save changes**.

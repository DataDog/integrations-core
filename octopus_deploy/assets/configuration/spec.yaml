        Optional configuration to indicate the spaces that we want to be processed. If not configured,
        all spaces and their corresponding project groups and projects are be processed.

        The 'include' key indicates the regular expressions of the spaces for reporting metrics 
        and the configuration to be applied to each of them. Each group can have a 'project-groups'-like configuration,
        that enables or disables metric collection for the project groups matching that condition. For further details
        see the next section, 'project-groups'. If no configuration associated with the key is indicated with the regular
        expression, they are be processed with the default configuration.

        The spaces are processed in the order indicated in the 'include'.
        If a space is matched on an 'include' key, it is only processed there and not in a later 'include'
        that it might match on.

        The 'exclude' key indicates the regular expressions of those spaces for not reporting metrics.
        The excludes have priority over the includes, that is, if a space matches an exclude, it is not
        processed even if it matches an include. The 'include' key must be used if using the 'exclude' key.

        The 'limit' key allows limiting the number of spaces processed to avoid a combinatorial explosion of tags
        associated with a metric.

        The 'interval' key indicates the validity time of the last list of spaces obtained through the endpoint.
        If 'interval' is not indicated, the list of spaces is obtained each time the check is executed
        and is not cached.

        In the following example, only the space named "default" is collected. Additionally, only the project groups
        starting with "test" in that space are collected. All other project groups and spaces are ignored.
        Furthermore, the cache is valid for 1 minute.

        Optional configuration to indicate the project groups that we want to be processed. If not configured,
        all project groups are processed.

        The 'include' key indicates the regular expressions of the project groups for reporting metrics
        and the configuration to be applied to each of them. Each group can have a 'projects'-like
        configuration, that enables or disables metric collection for the projects matching that condition. For
        further details see previous section 'projects'. If no configuration associated with the key is indicated with
        the regular expression, they are be processed with the default configuration.

        The project groups are processed in the order indicated in the 'include'.
        If a project group is matched on an 'include' key, it is only processed there and not in a later 'include'
        that it might match on.

        The 'exclude' key indicates the regular expressions of those project groups for not reporting metrics.
        The excludes has priority over the includes, that is, if a project group matches an exclude, it is not
        processed even if it matches an include. The 'include' key must be used if using the 'exclude' key.

        The 'limit' key allows limiting the number of project groups processed to avoid a combinatorial explosion of
        tags associated with a metric.

        The 'interval' key indicates the validity time of the last list of project groups obtained through the
        endpoint. If 'interval' is not indicated, the list of project groups are obtained each time the check is
        executed and is not cached.

        In the following example, all project groups are processed except those whose name begins with 'tmp_'
        up to a maximum of 10 project groups.
        Furthermore, the cache is valid for 1 minute.

          The environments are processed in the order indicated in the 'include'.

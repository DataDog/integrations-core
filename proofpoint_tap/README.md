## Overview

[Proofpoint TAP (Targeted Attack Protection)][1] is a cybersecurity solution designed to detect, mitigate, and block advanced threats that target people through email. It uses a next-generation email security platform to provide visibility into all email communications.

This integration ingests the following logs:

- **Click Events**: These logs provide information about user interactions with links in emails, including whether clicks were permitted or blocked, along with associated threat identification.
- **Message Events**: These logs provide information about email messages analyzed by Proofpoint TAP, including detection outcomes, delivery status (such as delivered or blocked), and threat identification.

This integration gathers and forwards above mentioned events to Datadog for seamless analysis. Datadog uses its built-in log pipelines to parse and enrich these logs, facilitating easy search and detailed insights. With preconfigured dashboards, the integration offers clear visibility into activities within the Proofpoint TAP platform. Additionally, it includes ready-to-use Cloud SIEM detection rules for enhanced monitoring and security.

# Agent Check: Harbor

## Overview

This check monitors [Harbor][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][2] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The Harbor check is included in the [Datadog Agent][3] package. No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `harbor.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][4] to start collecting your Harbor performance data. See the [sample harbor.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][6].

You can specify any type of user in the config but an account with admin permissions is required to fetch disk metrics. The metric `harbor.projects.count` only reflects the number of projects the provided user can access.

#### Log Collection

**Available for Agent >6.0**

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, you need to enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    logs_enabled: true
    ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `harbor.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Harbor logs:

    ```yaml
    logs:
    - type: file
        path: /var/log/harbor/core.log
        source: harbor
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    - type: file
        path: /var/log/harbor/proxy.log
        source: harbor
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    - type: file
        path: /var/log/harbor/portal.log
        source: harbor
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    - type: file
        path: /var/log/harbor/registry.log
        source: harbor
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    - type: file
        path: /var/log/harbor/registryctl.log
        source: harbor
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    - type: file
        path: /var/log/harbor/jobservice.log
        source: harbor
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    - type: file
        path: /var/log/harbor/postgresql.log
        source: harbor
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    - type: file
        path: /var/log/harbor/redis.log
        source: harbor
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    ```

    Change the `path` and `service` parameter values and configure them for your environment. See the [sample harbor.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

3. [Restart the Agent][6].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `harbor` under the Checks section.

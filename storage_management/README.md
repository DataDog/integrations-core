# Storage Management

## Overview

Storage Management provides visibility into Amazon S3 storage inventory, cost analysis, and optimization with prefix-level visibility. When any S3 inventory metric is present in your account, the integration is auto-installed and the out-of-the-box dashboard becomes available.

## Setup

No agent installation is required. The tile is auto-installed when S3 storage inventory metrics exist in your Datadog environment.

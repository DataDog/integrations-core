## All options defined here are available to all instances.
#
init_config:

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Additionally, this sets the default `service` for every log source.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

## Every instance is scheduled independently of the others.
#
instances:

  -
    ## @param host - string - optional - default: .
    ## The host the current check connects to.
    ## "." means the current host
    #
    # host: .

    ## @param username - string - optional
    ## The username from the credentials needed to connect to the host.
    #
    # username: <USERNAME>

    ## @param password - string - optional
    ## The password from the credentials needed to connect to the host.
    #
    # password: <PASSWORD>

    ## @param admin_share - string - optional - default: c$
    ## The administrative share to connect to. Can be a drive or the `ipc$` share if available.
    ## Note that to be able to connect to remote hosts the administrative share needs to be enabled and the
    ## user needs network administrator permissions
    ## If the remote machine doesn't expose any, set this to the empty string `""` to connect without an admin share.
    #
    # admin_share: c$

    ## @param countersetname - string - required
    ## The name of the performance counter set.
    ##
    ##   The following example fetches the number of processes and users:
    ##   # - countersetname: Processor
    ##   #   metrics:
    ##   #     - ['% Processor Time', pdh.processor.time, gauge]
    ##   #     - ['% User Time', pdh.processor.user.time, gauge]
    #
    countersetname: <COUNTER_SET_NAME>

    ## @param metrics - list of lists - required
    ## A list of metrics you want to capture, with each item in the
    ## list being a set of [<COUNTER_NAME>, <METRIC_NAME>, <METRIC_TYPE>]:
    ##   * <COUNTER_NAME> is something like `NumberOfUsers` or `ThreadCount`.
    ##                    The standard properties are also available on the MSDN docs for each
    ##                    class. It's recommend to wrap the property in quotes to avoid YAML parsing
    ##                    issues.
    ##   * <METRIC_NAME> is the metric name you want to show up in Datadog.
    ##   * <METRIC_TYPE> is from the standard choices for all agent checks, such
    ##                   as gauge, rate, histogram or counter.
    #
    metrics:
      - [<COUNTER_NAME>, <METRIC_NAME>, <METRIC_TYPE>]

    ## @param counter_data_types - list of strings - optional
    ## counter_data_types is a list of <METRIC_NAME>,<DATA_TYPE> elements that
    ## allow the precision in which counters are queried on a per metric basis.
    ## <METRIC_NAME>: The name of your metric
    ## <DATA_TYPE>  : The type of your metric (int or float)
    #
    # counter_data_types:
    #   - <METRIC_NAME>,<DATA_TYPE>
    #   - processor.time,int
    #   - processor.user.time,float

    ## @param tags - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of tags to attach to every metric and service check emitted by this instance.
    ##
    ## Learn more about tagging at https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging
    #
    # tags:
    #   - <KEY_1>:<VALUE_1>
    #   - <KEY_2>:<VALUE_2>

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Overrides any `service` defined in the `init_config` section.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

    ## @param min_collection_interval - number - optional - default: 15
    ## This changes the collection interval of the check. For more information, see:
    ## https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/write_agent_check/#collection-interval
    #
    # min_collection_interval: 15

    ## @param empty_default_hostname - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## This forces the check to send metrics with no hostname.
    ##
    ## This is useful for cluster-level checks.
    #
    # empty_default_hostname: false

    ## @param metric_patterns - mapping - optional
    ## A mapping of metrics to include or exclude, with each entry being a regular expression.
    ##
    ## Metrics defined in `exclude` will take precedence in case of overlap.
    #
    # metric_patterns:
    #   include:
    #   - <INCLUDE_REGEX>
    #   exclude:
    #   - <EXCLUDE_REGEX>

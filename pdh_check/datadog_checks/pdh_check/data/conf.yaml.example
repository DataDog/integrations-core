instances:

    ## @param host - string - required

    ## "." means the current host
    #
    # host: <HOST>

    ## @param username - string - optional
    ## Username from the credentials needed to connect to the host.

    # username: <USER_NAME>

    ## @param password - string - optional
    ## Password from the credentials needed to connect to the host.

    ## The following example fetches the number of processes and users:
    ##
    ## - countersetname: Processor
    ##   metrics:
    ##     - ['% Processor Time', pdh.processor.time, gauge]
    ##     - ['% User Time', pdh.processor.user.time, gauge]

    ## @param countersetname - string - required
    ## `countersetname` is the name of the performance counter
    #
    - countersetname: <PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_NAME>

    ## @param metrics - list of metrics - required
    ## `metrics` is a list of metrics you want to capture, with each item in the
    ##  list being a set of [<COUNTER_NAME>, <METRIC_NAME>, <METRIC_TYPE>]:
    ##    * <COUNTER_NAME> is something like `NumberOfUsers` or `ThreadCount`.
    ##                     The standard properties are also available on the MSDN docs for each
    ##                     class. It's recommend to wrap the property in quotes to avoid YAML parsing
    ##                     issues.
    ##    * <METRIC_NAME> is the metric name you want to show up in Datadog.
    ##    * <METRIC_TYPE> is from the standard choices for all agent checks, such
    ##                    as gauge, rate, histogram or counter.

    metrics:
      - ['<COUNTER_NAME>', <METRIC_NAME>, <METRIC_TYPE>]

    ## @param additional_metrics - list of lists - optional
    ## The additional metrics is a list of items that represent additional counters to collect.
    ## Each item is a list of strings, formatted as follows:
    ##
    ## ['<COUNTERSET_NAME>', <COUNTER_INSTANCE_NAME>, '<COUNTER_NAME>', <METRIC_NAME>, <METRIC_TYPE>]
    ##
    ## <COUNTERSET_NAME> is the name of the PDH Counter Set (the name of the counter)
    ## <COUNTER_INSTANCE_NAME> is the specific counter instance to collect, for example
    ##                          "Default Web Site".  Specify 'none' For all instances of
    ##                          the counter.
    ## <COUNTER_NAME> is the individual counter to report
    ## <METRIC_NAME> is the name you want to show up in Datadog
    ## <METRIC_TYPE> is from the standard choices for all agent checks, such as gauge,
    ##                rate, histogram or counter
    #
    # additional_metrics:
    #   - ['NTDS', none, 'DS % Writes from LDAP', active_directory.ds.writes_from_ldap, gauge]

    ## @param counter_data_types - list of strings - optional
    ## counter_data_types is a list of <METRIC_NAME>,<DATA_TYPE> element that
    ## allows the precision with which counters are queried on a per metric basis
    ## <METRIC_NAME>: Name of your metric
    ## <DATA_TYPE>  : Type of your metric, can be int, float
    #
    # counter_data_types:
    #   - <METRIC_NAME>,<DATA_TYPE>
    #   - active_directory.dra.inbound.bytes.total,int
    #   - active_directory.ldap.bind_time,float

    ## @param tags - list of key:value element - optional
    ## List of tags to attach to every metric, event and service check emitted by this integration.

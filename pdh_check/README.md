# Wmi_check Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Windows performance counters in real time to:

The PDH check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your servers.

### Configuration

Edit the `pdh_check.yaml` file to collect Windows performance data. See the [sample pdh_check.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/pdh_check/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-commands/#agent-status-and-information) and look for `pdh_check` under the Checks section:

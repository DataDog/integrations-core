  # Each PDH query has 3 required options:
  # countersetname is the name of the performance counter
  #
  # `metrics` is a list of metrics you want to capture, with each item in the
  # list being a set of [counter name, metric name, metric type].
  #
  # - The property (counter) name is something like `NumberOfUsers` or `ThreadCount`.
  #   The standard properties are also available on the MSDN docs for each
  #   class. We recommend to wrap the property in quotes to avoid YAML parsing
  #   issues.
  #
  # - The metric name is the name you want to show up in Datadog.
  #
  # - The metric type is from the standard choices for all agent checks, such
  #   as gauge, rate, histogram or counter.
  #
  # `filters` is a list of filters on a multi-instance counter you may want. For example,
  # for a process-based counter, you may want metrics for only certain
  # processes running on your machine, so you could add a filter for each
  # process name. You can also use the '%' character as a wildcard.
  # See below for examples.
  #
  # `tags` optionally lets you tag each metric with a set of fixed values.
  #

  # Fetch the number of processes and users.

      - ['File Read Operations/sec', pdh.system.file_read_per_sec, gauge]

  # Fetch metrics for a single running application, called myapp, tagging with 'role:test'.

      description: |
        The administrative share to connect to. Can be a drive or the `ipc$` share if available.
        Note that to be able to connect to remote hosts the administrative share needs to be enabled and the
        user needs network administrator permissions
        If the remote machine doesn't expose any, set this to the empty string `""` to connect without an admin share.

        The name of the performance counter set.

          The following example fetches the number of processes and users:
          # - countersetname: Processor
          #   metrics:
          #     - ['% Processor Time', pdh.processor.time, gauge]
          #     - ['% User Time', pdh.processor.user.time, gauge]

      description: |
        A list of metrics you want to capture, with each item in the
        list being a set of [<COUNTER_NAME>, <METRIC_NAME>, <METRIC_TYPE>]:
          * <COUNTER_NAME> is something like `NumberOfUsers` or `ThreadCount`.
                           The standard properties are also available on the MSDN docs for each
                           class. It's recommend to wrap the property in quotes to avoid YAML parsing
                           issues.
          * <METRIC_NAME> is the metric name you want to show up in Datadog.
          * <METRIC_TYPE> is from the standard choices for all agent checks, such
                          as gauge, rate, histogram or counter.

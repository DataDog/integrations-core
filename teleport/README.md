# Agent Check: Teleport

## Overview

This check monitors [Teleport][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][3] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

The Teleport integration is included in the Datadog Agent package. No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Prerequisites

The Teleport check gathers Teleport's metrics and performance data using two distinct endpoints:

- The [Health endpoint](https://goteleport.com/docs/management/diagnostics/monitoring/#healthz) provides the overall health status of your Teleport instance.
- The [OpenMetrics endpoint](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/metrics/#auth-service-and-backends) extracts metrics on the Teleport instance and the various services operating within that instance.

These endpoints aren't activated by default. To enable the diagnostic HTTP endpoints in your Teleport instance, please refer to the public Teleport [documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/management/diagnostics/monitoring/#enable-health-monitoring).

### Configuration

##### Metric collection

1. Edit the `teleport.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your teleport performance data. See the [sample teleport.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

##### Log collection

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, enable it in your `datadog.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

2. Edit the `logs` section of your `teleport.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Teleport logs:

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: file
       path: /var/log/teleport/teleport.log
       source: teleport
       service: telepor-service
      log_processing_rules:
         - type: multi_line
         name: logs_start_with_date
         pattern: \d{4}\-(0?[1-9]|1[012])\-(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])
   ```

3. [Restart the Agent][8].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `teleport` under the Checks section.

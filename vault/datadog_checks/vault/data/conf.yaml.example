init_config:

instances:
  - api_url: http://localhost:8200/v1

  # The default configuration does not require a client token.
  # client_token: TOKEN

  # Whether or not this instance should report cluster leader change events.
  # detect_leader: false

  # tags:
  #   - instance:foo

  # If the API endpoint is behind basic auth:
  # username: USERNAME
  # password: PASSWORD

  # If Vault setup uses SSL, you might need to set the following options as well.

  # You can specify a local cert to use as client side certificate
  # as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate concatenated)
  # client_cert_file: '/path/to/client.concatenated.pem'

  # Or as two separate files (for certificate and key):
  # client_cert_file: '/path/to/client.cert.pem'
  # private_key_file: '/path/to/private.key.pem'

  # The (optional) ssl_verify parameter will instruct the check to validate SSL
  # certificates when connecting to Vault. Defaulting to true, set to false if
  # you want to disable SSL certificate validation.
  #
  # ssl_verify: true
  #
  # If ssl_verify is enabled, optionally specify a path to
  # a ca bundle file or directory to trust additional roots
  # ca_bundle_path: '/path/to/trusted_ca_bundle_file'
  #
  # If you disable the ssl_verify above, you will still receive security
  # warnings in logs. You can disable those too using the flag below.
  #
  # ssl_ignore_warning: false

  # The (optional) skip_proxy parameter will bypass any proxy
  # settings enabled and attempt to reach Vault directly.
  #
  # skip_proxy: false

  # If you need to specify a custom timeout in seconds for API access (default is 20):
  # timeout: 20

# Bitdefender integration for Datadog

## Overview

[Bitdefender][1] provides cybersecurity solutions with leading security efficacy, performance, and ease of use to small and medium businesses, mid-market enterprises, and consumers. Bitdefender EDR effectively stops ransomware and breaches with automated cross-endpoint correlation and seamlessly integrated prevention, protection, detection, and response.

The Bitdefender integration uses a webhook to ingest Bitdefender EDR logs. The integration provides OOTB dashboards and detection rules for the following event types:

| Event                         | Trigger                                                                                                                                                           |

## Setup

### Create a Bitdefender API Key

1. Log in to Bitdefender Business Security Enterprise Portal using an administrator account. Your account must have the following rights:
   - Manage Networks
   - Manage Users
   - Manage Company
   - View and analyze data
2. Click **User menu**, then click **My Account**.
3. Navigate to the **API keys** section.
4. Click **Add**. The API Key Configuration window opens.
5. Provide the following information:
    - **API Key Description**: A relevant name for your API key
    - **Enabled APIs**: Select all services.
6. Click **Generate** and copy the generated API key. 
7. Perform Base64 encoding on the generated API key. You'll use the encoded API key for webhook configuration.
    1. Take your API key and append a colon (\:) to it, like this: `<api_key>:`
    2. Encode the resulting string using a Base64 encoder.
    
    For example, if your API key is abc123, the string to encode is `abc123:` After Base64 encoding, the result will be something 
    like `YWJjMTIzOg==`.

8. Navigate to the **Control Center API** section and note the Access URL. In the next section, you'll use this URL in the curl command as **\<control_center_apis_access_url>**.

For more information, see the [API Key and Authentication Reference Document][3].

### Configure a webhook in Datadog
1. In Datadog, navigate to the **Integrations** tab, and search for the Bitdefender integration.
2. Click the **Bitdefender** integration. The integration window opens. On the **Configure** tab, select an existing API key, or create a new one.
3. After selecting an API key, click **Add API key**, then click **Click Here to Copy URL**.
4. Make a curl request. Use the template below, putting values into the following fields: 
    - **\<control_center_apis_access_url>**: The URL from the previous section
    - **\<bitdefender-encoded-api-key>**: Your encoded API key
    - **\<dd-api-key>**: Your Datadog API key
    - **\<webhook_url>**:  The URL you copied in step 3
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -k "<control_center_apis_access_url>/v1.0/jsonrpc/push" --header "Authorization: Basic <bitdefender-encoded-api-key>" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"params\": {\"status\": 1,\"serviceType\": \"jsonRPC\",\"serviceSettings\": {\"url\": \"<webhook_url>\",\"requireValidSslCertificate\": false,\"authorization\": \"<dd-api-key>\"},\"subscribeToEventTypes\": {\"av\": true,\"aph\": true,\"fw\": true,\"avc\": true,\"uc\": true,\"dp\": true,\"hd\": true,\"exchange-malware\": true,\"network-sandboxing\": true,\"new-incident\": true,\"antiexploit\": true,\"network-monitor\": true,\"ransomware-mitigation\": true,\"storage-antimalware\": true}},\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\"method\": \"setPushEventSettings\",\"id\": \"bitdefender_push\"}"
    ```
    **Note**: If you're using Windows, add `^` before `&ddsource` in the **webhook_url** parameter.
    Here's an example of a completed curl request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -k "https://cloudap.gravityzone.bitdefender.com/api/v1.0/jsonrpc/push" --header "Authorization: Basic <bitdefender-encoded-api-key>" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"params\": {\"status\": 1,\"serviceType\": \"jsonRPC\",\"serviceSettings\": {\"url\": \"https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com/api/v2/logs?dd-api-key=<dd-api-key>&ddsource=bitdefender\",\"requireValidSslCertificate\": false,\"authorization\": \"<dd-api-key>\"},\"subscribeToEventTypes\": {\"av\": true,\"aph\": true,\"fw\": true,\"avc\": true,\"uc\": true,\"dp\": true,\"hd\": true,\"exchange-malware\": true,\"network-sandboxing\": true\"new-incident\": true,\"antiexploit\": true,\"network-monitor\": true,\"ransomware-mitigation\": true,\"storage-antimalware\": true,}},\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\"method\": \"setPushEventSettings\",\"id\": \"bitdefender_push\"}"
    ```
	
    After you make the curl request, you should receive a response indicating your connection has been established successfully.
5. In Datadog, filter your logs in Log Explorer to ensure data is populating properly in your dashboard.

## Goal
Identify cases where a large number of files are created within a short period, which may indicate automated data exfiltration, unauthorized software execution, or system abuse.

## Strategy
Monitor Mac audit logs for events indicating bulk file creation to detect potential malicious activities, such as script-based attacks, ransomware staging, or unauthorized file operations.

## Triage and response
1. Identify the user `{{@usr.name}}` or process responsible for the bulk file creation and check if it is expected behavior.
2. Determine the file paths `{{@record.path}}`, extensions, and content type to assess if they belong to a legitimate application or a suspicious operation.
3. Analyze the system activity before and after the bulk file creation to detect any associated unauthorized access or script execution.
4. Correlate with other security logs to identify potential threats, such as large outbound data transfers or privilege escalation.
5. Remediate by restricting excessive file creation permissions, monitoring for further anomalies, and investigating any unauthorized processes.

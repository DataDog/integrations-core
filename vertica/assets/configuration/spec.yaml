              Whether or not to enable connection load balancing. This helps automatically spread
              the overhead caused by client connections across clusters by having hosts redirect
              client connections to other hosts. If the server disables connection load balancing,
              load balancing requests is ignored.

              Setting this to `true` will force the creation of a new connection at every check run.

              This option exists because vertica-python logging is disabled by default
              and must be enabled explicitly.
              When this option is not set, library logging is disabled, or set to DEBUG
              when the Agent log level is DEBUG or lower (TRACE).

# Agent Check: Vertica

## Overview

This check monitors [Vertica][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

### Installation

The Vertica check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package. No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

Edit the `vertica.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your vertica performance data. See the example [vertica.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

#### Enabling SSL

The Vertica integration supports connecting to Vertica through SSL. To enable this, set `use_tls` in `conf.yaml` to `true`. 

**Note**: For Vertica integration versions <=1.9.0, set `tls_verify` to `true` instead. For legacy support, if `tls_verify` is explicitly set to `true`, `use_tls` is set to `true`.

#### Prepare Vertica

Create a database user for the Datadog Agent. From [vsql][4], connect to the database as a superuser. Then run the `CREATE USER` statement.

```text
CREATE USER datadog IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
```

The user used to connect to the database must be granted the [SYSMONITOR][5] role in order to access the monitoring system tables.

```text
GRANT SYSMONITOR TO datadog WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```

As the metrics for current license usage use the values from the most recent [audit][6], Datadog recommends scheduling audits to occur as often as possible. For more information, see the [Vertica audit license guide][7].

[Restart the Agent][8] to start sending Vertica metrics to Datadog.

#### Log collection

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, enable it in your `datadog.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    logs_enabled: true
    ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `vertica.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your Vertica logs:

    ```yaml
    logs:
      - source: vertica
        type: file
        path: "/<CATALOG_PATH>/<DATABASE_NAME>/<NODE_NAME>_catalog/vertica.log"
        service: vertica
    ```

3. [Restart the Agent][8].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][9] and look for `vertica` under the Checks section.

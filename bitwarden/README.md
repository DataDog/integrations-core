# Bitwarden

## Overview

[Bitwarden][1] is a password manager that generates, stores, and secures important digital assets in an end-to-end encrypted vault. Users can access their data from anywhere, on any device (desktop, laptop, mobile devices) with secure cloud syncing or self-hosted deployment.

This integration ingests the following logs:

- Event Logs: These logs include information about item events, user events, collection events, group events, and organization events.

This integration seamlessly collects event logs, channeling them into Datadog for analysis. Leveraging the built-in logs pipeline, these logs are parsed and enriched, enabling effortless search and analysis. The integration provides insight into event logs through out-of-the-box dashboards and includes ready-to-use Cloud SIEM detection rules for improved monitoring and security.

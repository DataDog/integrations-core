# Agent Check: StatsD

## Overview

This check monitors the availability and uptime of non-Datadog StatsD servers. It also tracks the number of metrics, by metric type, received by StatsD.

This check does **NOT** forward application metrics from StatsD servers to Datadog. It collects metrics about StatsD itself.

## Setup
### Installation

The StatsD check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on any servers that run StatsD.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `statsd.d/conf.yaml` in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's directory. See the [sample statsd.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options:

    ```yaml
        init_config:

        instances:
            - host: localhost
            port: 8126 # or wherever your statsd listens
    ```

    Configuration Options

    - `host` (Optional) - Host to be checked. This will be included as a tag: `host:<host>`. Defaults to `localhost`.
    - `port` (Optional) - Port to be checked. This will be included as a tag: `port:<port>`. Defaults to `8126`.
    - `timeout` (Optional) - Timeout for the check. Defaults to 10 seconds.
    - `tags` (Optional) - Tags to be assigned to the metric.

2. [Restart the Agent][3] to start sending StatsD metrics and service checks to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `statsd` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected
### Metrics
See [metadata.csv][5] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events
The StatsD check does not include any event at this time.

### Service Checks

**statsd.is_up**:

Returns CRITICAL if the StatsD server does not respond to the Agent's health status request, otherwise OK.

**statsd.can_connect**:

Returns CRITICAL if the Agent cannot collect metrics about StatsD, otherwise OK.

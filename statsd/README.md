# Agent Check: StatsD

## Overview

This check monitors the availability and uptime of non-Datadog StatsD servers. It also tracks the number of metrics, by metric type, received by StatsD.

This check does **NOT** forward application metrics from StatsD servers to Datadog. It collects metrics about StatsD itself.

## Setup

### Installation

The StatsD check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on any servers that run StatsD.

### Configuration

#### Host

Follow the instructions below to configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Containerized](#containerized) section.

1. Edit the `statsd.d/conf.yaml` in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2]. See the [sample statsd.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options:

   ```yaml
   init_config:

   instances:
     - host: localhost
       port: 8126 # or wherever your statsd listens
   ```

2. [Restart the Agent][4] to start sending StatsD metrics and service checks to Datadog.

#### Containerized

For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][10] for guidance on applying the parameters below.

| Parameter            | Value                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` | `statsd`                              |
| `<INIT_CONFIG>`      | blank or `{}`                         |
| `<INSTANCE_CONFIG>`  | `{"host": "%%host%%", "port":"8126"}` |

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][5] and look for `statsd` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][6] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The StatsD check does not include any events.

### Service Checks

**statsd.is_up**:

Returns CRITICAL if the StatsD server does not respond to the Agent's health status request, otherwise OK.

**statsd.can_connect**:

Returns CRITICAL if the Agent cannot collect metrics about StatsD, otherwise OK.

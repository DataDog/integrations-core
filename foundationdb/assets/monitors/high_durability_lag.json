  "description": "Durability lag refers to the time delay between when data is written to a database and when it is fully committed and made durable. This monitor tracks the average durability lag for each specific process to ensure data remains consistent.",
  "definition": {
    "message": "{{#is_alert}}\nThe storage process has very high durability lag - that is, the time it takes for data fetched by the storage server to be written to disk.\n{{/is_alert}}\n{{#is_warning}}\nThe storage process has higher than usual durability lag - that is, the time it takes for data fetched by the storage server to be written to disk.\n{{/is_warning}}\n\nThis may indicate that the database cluster cannot keep up with the workload. Sometimes, storage servers can also struggle if faced with a huge number of reads of the keys they store, preventing progress on writes.",

      description: |
        A path to the cluster file specifing connection to the FoundationDB.
        If the check does not pass, it will rely on the binding library to find
        the file using standard locations (e.g. `/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster` or
        `/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster`).
      value:
        example: /var/lib/foundationdb/fdb.cluster

    - name: copy_cluster_file
      description: |
        Whether to make a writable copy of the given `cluster_file` before
        passing it to the FoundationDB client. FoundationDB clients generally
        need to be able to write to cluster files in the event of cluster
        topology changes. This option can be useful in environments where
        making a writable file available to the FoundationDB integration is
        difficult (i.e. mounting a `ConfigMap` in a Kubernetes deployment).
        This option has no effect if `cluster_file` is not specified.
      value:
        example: false
        type: boolean

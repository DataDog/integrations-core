    - name: local_cert_path
      description: |
        The path to a local certificate in lieu of a server/port. In this mode, the
        service checks `tls.can_connect` and `tls.version` are unavailable. The
        certificate can be in PEM or DER format. If in DER format, the file
        extension must be either `.cer`, `.crt`, or `.der`.
      value:
        type: string
    - name: server_hostname
      description: |
        The hostname of the service with which to connect for servers that support SNI. This
        is also the value used for hostname validation. If not specified, `server` parameter is used.

    - name: validate_hostname
      description: |
        Whether or not to verify the certificate was issued for `server_hostname`. If enabled,
        this is an additional requirement for the service check `tls.cert_validation`.
      value:
        type: boolean
        example: true
    - name: validate_cert
      description: |
        Whether or not to validate the certificate. If disabled, the service check
        `tls.cert_validation` always reports as OK except for:

        1. parsing errors
        2. hostname mismatch, if `validate_hostname` is true

        Disabling this is useful when only the monitoring of certificate expiration is desired.

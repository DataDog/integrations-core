-----

This is the developer toolkit designed for use by any [Agent-based][1] check or
integration repository. There are 2 layers: one purely for development/testing,
and the other for high level tasks such as releasing, dependency management, etc.

`datadog-checks-dev` is distributed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) as a universal wheel
and is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and supports Python 2.7/3.5+ and PyPy.

## Management

This is the layer that provides the developer CLI.

### Installation

```console
$ pip install datadog-checks-dev[cli]
```

At this point there should be a working executable, `ddev`, in your PATH. The
help flag shortcut `-h` is available globally.

### Usage

Upon the first invocation, `ddev` will attempt to create the config file if it
does not yet exist. `integrations-core` will be the target if the path exists
unless otherwise specified, defaulting to the current location. This allows
for full functionality no matter where you are.

```console
$ ddev
Usage: ddev [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -e, --extras  Work on `integrations-extras`.
  -x, --here    Work on the current location.
  -q, --quiet
  --version     Show the version and exit.
  -h, --help    Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  clean     Remove a project's build artifacts
  config    Manage the config file
  dep       Manage dependencies
  manifest  Manage manifest files
  release   Manage the release of checks
  test      Run tests
```

#### Clean

```console
$ ddev clean -h
Usage: ddev clean [OPTIONS] [CHECK]

  Removes a project's build artifacts.

  If `check` is not specified, the current working directory will be used.

  All `*.pyc`/`*.pyd`/`*.pyo`/`*.whl` files and `__pycache__` directories
  will be removed. Additionally, the following patterns will be removed from
  the root of the path: `.cache`, `.coverage`, `.eggs`, `.pytest_cache`,
  `.tox`, `build`, `dist`, and `*.egg-info`.

Options:
  -c, --compiled-only  Removes only .pyc files.
  -a, --all            Disable the detection of a project's dedicated virtual
                       env and/or editable installation. By default, these
                       will not be considered.
  -v, --verbose        Shows removed paths.
  -h, --help           Show this message and exit.
```

```

This config file looks like this:

```toml

##### Show

> To avoid GitHub's public API rate limits, you need to set `github.user`/`github.token`
> in your config file or use the `DD_GITHUB_USER`/`DD_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variables.

```console
$ ddev release show
Usage: ddev release show [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  To avoid GitHub's public API rate limits, you need to set
  `github.user`/`github.token` in your config file or use the
  `DD_GITHUB_USER`/`DD_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variables.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  changes  Show all the pending PRs for a given check
  ready    Show all the checks that can be released

  (e.g. re-align an old release performed on the wrong commit).

  If no checks are specified, this will only test checks that were changed
  compared to the master branch.

  -b, --bench  Run only benchmarks
  --every      Run every kind of test
  -h, --help   Show this message and exit.
```

## Development

This is the layer intended to be used directly for testing.

### Installation

```console
$ pip install datadog-checks-dev
```

This comes with `pytest`, `mock`, and other core requirements for testing.
Most likely you will not install this manually, but rather list it as the
only dependency in a check's `requirements-dev.txt`.

### Usage

Aside from being a source for test dependencies, this also provides many useful
utilities and global `pytest` fixtures to avoid re-inventing the wheel.

#### Fixtures

##### Aggregator

The `aggregator` fixture returns a [mocked Agent aggregator][2] with state cleared.

```python
from datadog_checks.vault import Vault

def test_service_check_connect_fail(aggregator):
    instance = {'api_url': 'http://1.2.3.4:567', 'timeout': 1}
    c = Vault(Vault.CHECK_NAME, None, {}, [instance])
    c.check(instance)

    aggregator.assert_service_check(
        Vault.SERVICE_CHECK_CONNECT,
        status=Vault.CRITICAL,
        count=1
    )
```

##### Mocker

The `mocker` fixture, provided by [pytest-mock](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock),
is a thin-wrapper around `mock`'s patching API with the benefit of not having to worry
about undoing patches at the end of a test or nesting `with` statements.

Example from the docs:

```python
import os

class UnixFS:

    @staticmethod
    def rm(filename):
        os.remove(filename)

def test_unix_fs(mocker):
    mocker.patch('os.remove')
    UnixFS.rm('file')
    os.remove.assert_called_once_with('file')
```

#### Utilities

Utilities live under the `datadog_checks.dev` namespace and can be found [here][3].

Some examples:

##### Subprocess commands

```python
>>> from datadog_checks.dev import run_command
>>>
>>> # Command can be a list or string
>>> result = run_command('python -c "import sys;print(sys.version)"', capture='out')
>>> result.stdout
'3.6.1 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, May 23 2017, 14:21:39) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\n'
>>>
```

##### Temporary directories

```python
>>> import os
>>> from datadog_checks.dev import temp_chdir
>>>
>>> origin = os.getcwd()
>>>
>>> with temp_chdir() as d:
...     assert d == os.getcwd()
...     # Symlinks are properly resolved to prevent permission errors on macOS
...     assert d == os.path.realpath(d)
...
>>> assert origin == os.getcwd()
>>>

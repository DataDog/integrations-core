# Logs-only Integration

Choose this type of integration if you only need some pipelines and configuration for collecting and processing logs via the Agent.

To help customers get started with their config we turn this integration into a Python package that can be installed in the Agent.
We release these integrations just like Agent Checks and manage the changelog with towncrier in integrations-core.

    ```yaml
      logs_enabled: true
    ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `{check_name}.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your {integration_name} logs:

    ```yaml
      logs:
        - type: file
          path:  /var/log/{integration_name}.log
          source: {check_name}
          service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    ```

    Change the `path` and `service` parameter values and configure them for your environment.

3. [Restart the Agent][2].

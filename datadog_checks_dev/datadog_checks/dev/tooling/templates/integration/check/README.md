# Python Agent Check

Also known as "Agent Integration", choose this template type if you need to write Python code to collect data (metrics, events, logs etc.) and submit them to Datadog via the Agent.

It's as a Python package that one can install in the Agent.
We manage the Changelog with towncrier in integrations-core and by hand in other repositories.

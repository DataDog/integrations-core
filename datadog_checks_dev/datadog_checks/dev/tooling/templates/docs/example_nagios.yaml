            Send events from your Nagios-monitored infrastructure to Datadog for richer alerting and to help correlate Nagios events with metrics from your Datadog-monitored infrastructure.

            This check watches your Nagios server's logs and sends events to your Datadog event stream: track service flaps, host state changes, passive service checks, host and service downtimes, and more. This check can also send Nagios performance data as metrics to Datadog.

            To configure this check for an Agent running on a host:

            1. Edit the `nagios.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][1]. See the [sample nagios.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

            2. [Restart the Agent][3] to start sending Nagios events and (optionally) performance data metrics to Datadog.

            **Note**: The Nagios check can potentially emit [custom metrics][4], which may impact your [billing][5].

            With the default configuration, the Nagios check doesn't collect any metrics. But if you set `collect_host_performance_data` and/or `collect_service_performance_data` to `True`, the check watches for Nagios performance data and submits it as gauge metrics to Datadog.

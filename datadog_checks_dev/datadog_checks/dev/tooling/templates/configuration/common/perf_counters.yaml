- name: metrics
  description: |
    This mapping defines which metrics to collect from the performance
    counters on the `server`. For more information, see:
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/perfctrs/about-performance-counters

    The top-level keys are the names of the desired performance objects:

      metrics:
        System:
          <OPTION_1>: ...
          <OPTION_2>: ...
        LogicalDisk:
          <OPTION_1>: ...
          <OPTION_2>: ...

    The available performance object options are:

      name (required): This becomes the prefix of all metrics submitted for each counter.
      counters (required): This is the list of counters to collect.
      tag_name: This is the name of the tag used for instances. For example, if the tag name for
                the `LogicalDisk` performance object is `disk`, a possible tag would be `disk:C`.
                If not set, the default tag name is `instance`.
      include: This is the list of regular expressions used to select which instances to monitor.
               If not set, all instances are monitored.
      exclude: This is the list of regular expressions used to select which instances to ignore.
               If not set, no instances are ignored. Note: `_Total` instances are always ignored.
      include_fast: This is the list of wildcards or exact instance names used to select which
                    instances to monitor. It is faster than the regular expression `include` filter
                    because it relies on the Windows PDH built-in wildcard filtering.
      instance_counts: This is a mapping used to select the count of instances to submit, where each
                       key is a count type and the value is the metric name to use, ignoring `name`.
                       The `total` count type represents the total number of encountered instances.
                       The `monitored` count type represents the number of monitored instances after
                       `include`/`exclude` filtering. The `unique` count type represents the number
                       of unique instance names that are monitored.
      use_localized_counters: Whether or not performance object and counter names should refer to their
                              locale-specific versions rather than by their English name. This overrides
                              any defined value in `init_config`.

    The key for each counter object represents the name of the desired counter.
    Counters can be defined in the following ways:

    1. Mapping the counter name to a string. If a value is a string, then it represents the suffix of the sent metric
       name, for example:

         counters:
         - '% Free Space': usable
         - Current Disk Queue Length: queue_length.current

    2. Mapping the counter name to a set of options. If a value is a mapping, then it must have a `name` or
       `metric_name` key that represents the suffix or full metric name of the
       sent metric name, for example:

         counters:
         - '% Free Space':
             name: usable
             type: rate
         - Current Disk Queue Length:
             metric_name: queue_length.current
             average: true

    The available counter options are:

      type: This represents how the metric is handled, defaulting to `gauge`. The available types are:
            gauge, rate, count, monotonic_count, service_check, temporal_percent, and time_elapsed.
      average: When there are multiple values for the same instance name (for example, multiple processes
               spawned with the same name) the check submits the sum. Setting this option to `true`
               instructs the check to calculate the average instead.
      aggregate: Whether or not to send an additional metric that is the aggregation of all values for
                 every monitored instance. If `average` is set to `true` the check submits the average as
                 a metric suffixed by `avg`, otherwise it submits the sum as a metric suffixed by `sum`.
                 If this is set to `only`, the check does not submit a metric per instance.
      metric_name: This represents the full metric name in lieu of a `name` key and is not be prefixed by
                   the parent object's `name` key.

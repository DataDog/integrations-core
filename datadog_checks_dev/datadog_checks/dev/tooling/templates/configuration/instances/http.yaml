    This overrides the `proxy` setting in `init_config`.

    Set HTTP or HTTPS proxies for all instances. Use the `no_proxy` list
    to specify hosts that must bypass proxies.

    The SOCKS protocol is also supported like so:

      socks5://user:pass@host:port

    Using the scheme `socks5` causes the DNS resolution to happen on the
    client, rather than on the proxy server. This is in line with `curl`,
    which uses the scheme to decide whether to do the DNS resolution on
    the client or proxy. If you want to resolve the domains on the proxy
    server, use `socks5h` as the scheme.
- name: skip_proxy
  value:
    example: false
    type: boolean
  description: |
    This overrides the `skip_proxy` setting in `init_config`.

    settings enabled and attempt to reach services directly.

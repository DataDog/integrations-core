## Overview

[LastPass][1] is a password management solution that securely stores and manages passwords and other sensitive
information. LastPass provides users with the ability to generate passwords, synchronize passwords across multiple
devices, and add an extra layer of security through multi-factor authentication.

Integrate LastPass with Datadog to gain insights into reporting event logs through the LastPass Enterprise API. The data is
normalized and enriched before ingestion. Pre-built dashboard visualizations provide immediate insights into LastPass
reporting events, while out-of-the-box detection rules enhance detection and response capabilities.

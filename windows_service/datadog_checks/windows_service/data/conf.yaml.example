## All options defined here are available to all instances.
#
init_config:

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Additionally, this sets the default `service` for every log source.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

## Every instance is scheduled independently of the others.
#
instances:

    ## @param services - (list of string or mapping) - required
    ## List of services to monitor e.g. Dnscache, wmiApSrv, etc.
    ##
    ## Services can also be selectively monitored by their startup type and whether they have triggers
    ## The possible values for `startup_type` are:
    ##   - disabled
    ##   - manual
    ##   - automatic
    ##   - automatic_delayed_start
    ##
    ## The possible values for `trigger_start` are:
    ##   - true
    ##   - false
    ##
    ## If any service is set to `ALL`, all services registered with the SCM will be monitored, and
    ## all other patterns provided in this instance will be ignored.
    ##
    ## Service name patterns are case insensitive. `ALL` is case sensitive.
    ##
    ## NOTE: The service name patterns will match all services starting with the pattern. For example,
    ## if `service` is provided, it will match all services starting with `service` as if service.* is configured.
    ## For an exact match, use ^service$
    #
  - services:
      - <SERVICE_NAME_1>
      - name: <SERVICE_NAME_2>
      - startup_type: automatic
        trigger_start: false

    ## @param disable_legacy_service_tag - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## Whether or not to stop submitting the tag `service` that has been renamed
    ## to `windows_service` and disable the associated deprecation warning.
    #
    # disable_legacy_service_tag: false

    ## @param windows_service_startup_type_tag - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## Whether or not to submit the `windows_service_startup_type` tag along
    ## with each service check.
    ## This tag indicates the Windows service startup type as shown in a service's properties,
    ## and can be used as a filter/scope in Monitors.
    ## Possible values for this tag are:
    ##   - disabled
    ##   - manual
    ##   - automatic
    ##   - automatic_delayed_start
    #
    # windows_service_startup_type_tag: false

    ## @param tags - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of tags to attach to every metric and service check emitted by this instance.
    ##

    #
    # tags:
    #   - <KEY_1>:<VALUE_1>
    #   - <KEY_2>:<VALUE_2>

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Overrides any `service` defined in the `init_config` section.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

    ## @param min_collection_interval - number - optional - default: 15
    ## This changes the collection interval of the check. For more information, see:
    ## https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/write_agent_check/#collection-interval
    #
    # min_collection_interval: 15

    ## @param empty_default_hostname - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## This forces the check to send metrics with no hostname.
    ##
    ## This is useful for cluster-level checks.
    #
    # empty_default_hostname: false

    ## @param metric_patterns - mapping - optional
    ## A mapping of metrics to include or exclude, with each entry being a regular expression.
    ##
    ## Metrics defined in `exclude` will take precedence in case of overlap.
    #
    # metric_patterns:
    #   include:
    #   - <INCLUDE_REGEX>
    #   exclude:
    #   - <EXCLUDE_REGEX>

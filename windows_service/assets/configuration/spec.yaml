              List of services to monitor e.g. Dnscache, wmiApSrv, etc.

              Services can also be selectively monitored by their startup type and whether they have triggers
              The possible values for `startup_type` are:
                - disabled
                - manual
                - automatic
                - automatic_delayed_start

              The possible values for `trigger_start` are:
                - true
                - false

              If any service is set to `ALL`, all services registered with the SCM will be monitored, and
              all other patterns provided in this instance will be ignored.

              Service name patterns are case insensitive. `ALL` is case sensitive.

              NOTE: The service name patterns will match all services starting with the pattern. For example,
              if `service` is provided, it will match all services starting with `service` as if service.* is configured.
              For an exact match, use ^service$
            required: true

              Whether or not to submit the `windows_service_startup_type` tag along
              with each service check.
              This tag indicates the Windows service startup type as shown in a service's properties,
              and can be used as a filter/scope in Monitors.
              Possible values for this tag are:
                - disabled
                - manual
                - automatic
                - automatic_delayed_start

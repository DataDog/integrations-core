A significant increase in invites may indicate growing interest in your service, potential viral growth, or active marketing efforts. However, it could also signal unusual behavior or spam activities. By keeping an eye on this metric, you can assess user engagement and outreach effectiveness, as well as identify any anomalies that may require further investigation.",

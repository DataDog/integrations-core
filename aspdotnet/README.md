# ASP.NET Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from ASP.NET service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor ASP.NET states
* Be notified about ASP.NET failovers and events.

## Setup
### Installation

The ASP.NET check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `aspdotnet.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your ASP.NET performance data.

    See the [sample aspdotnet.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5]

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][2] and look for `aspdotnet` under the Checks section.

# ASP.NET Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from ASP.NET in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor ASP.NET states.
- Be notified about ASP.NET failovers and events.

## Setup

### Installation

The ASP.NET check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `aspdotnet.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][2] to start collecting your ASP.NET performance data. See the [sample aspdotnet.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][4]

#### Log collection

<!-- partial
{{< site-region region="us3" >}}
**Log collection is not supported for the Datadog {{< region-param key="dd_site_name" >}} site**.
{{< /site-region >}}
partial -->

ASP.NET uses IIS logging. Follow the [setup instructions for IIS][5] in order to view logs related to ASP.NET requests and failures. 

Unhandled 500 level exceptions and events related to your ASP.NET application can be viewed with the Windows Application EventLog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][6] and look for `aspdotnet` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

# Directory Check
## Overview

Capture metrics from directories and files of your choosing. The Agent will collect:

  * number of files
  * file size
  * age of the last modification
  * age of the creation

## Setup
### Installation

The directory check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `directory.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting Directory performance data.
  See the [sample directory.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

    ```yaml
      init_config:

      instances:
        - directory: "/path/to/directory" # the only required option
          name: "my_monitored_dir"        # What the Agent will tag this directory's metrics with. Defaults to "directory"
          pattern: "*.log"                # defaults to "*" (all files)
          recursive: True                 # default False
          countonly: False                # set to True to only collect the number of files matching 'pattern'. Useful for very large directories.
          ignore_missing: False           # set to True to not raise exceptions on missing or inaccessible directories
    ```

    Ensure that the user running the Agent process (usually `datadog-agent`) has read access to the directories, subdirectories, and files you configure.

    **Note**: On Windows when you add your directory, use double-backslashes `C:\\path\\to\\directory` instead of single-backslashes `C:\path\to\directory` for the check to run. Otherwise, the directory check fails with traceback ending in the error: `found unknown escape character in "<string>"`.

2. [Restart the Agent][3].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `directory` under the Checks section.

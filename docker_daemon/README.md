# Docker_daemon Integration

![Docker default dashboard][27]

## Overview

Configure this Agent check to get metrics from docker_daemon service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor docker_daemon states
* Be notified about docker_daemon failovers and events.

**NOTE**: The Docker check has been rewritten in Go for Agent v6 to take advantage of the new internal architecture. Hence it is still maintained but **only works with Agents prior to major version 6**.

**To learn how to use the Docker_daemon Integration with the Agent major version 6 [Consult our dedicated agent v6 setup](#agent-v6).**

## Setup
### Installation

To collect Docker metrics about all your containers, run **one** Datadog Agent on every host. There are two ways to run the Agent: directly on each host, or within a [docker-dd-agent container][1]. We recommend the latter.  

Whichever you choose, your hosts need to have cgroup memory management enabled for the Docker check to succeed. See the [docker-dd-agent repository][2] for how to enable it.

#### Host Installation

1. Ensure Docker is running on the host.
2. Install the Agent as described in [the Agent installation instructions][3] for your host OS.
3. Enable [the Docker integration tile in the application][4].
4. Add the Agent user to the docker group: `usermod -a -G docker dd-agent`
5. Create a `docker_daemon.yaml` file by copying [the example file in the agent conf.d directory][5]. If you have a standard install of Docker on your host, there shouldn't be anything you need to change to get the integration to work.
6. To enable other integrations, use `docker ps` to identify the ports used by the corresponding applications.
    ![Docker ps command][28]

**Note:** docker_daemon has replaced the older docker integration.

#### Container Installation

1. Ensure Docker is running on the host.
2. As per [the docker container installation instructions][6], run:

        docker run -d --name dd-agent \
          -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
          -v /proc/:/host/proc/:ro \
          -v /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
          -e API_KEY={YOUR API KEY} \
          datadog/docker-dd-agent:latest

Note that in the command above, you are able to pass your API key to the Datadog Agent using Docker's `-e` environment variable flag. Some other variables you can pass include:

| **Variable** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| API_KEY | Sets your Datadog API key. |
| DD_HOSTNAME | Sets the hostname in the Agent container's datadog.conf file. If this variable is not set, the Agent container will default to using the `Name` field (as reported by the `docker info` command) as the Agent container hostname. |
| DD_URL | Sets the Datadog intake server URL where the Agent will send data. This is useful when [using an agent as a proxy][7]. |
| LOG_LEVEL | Sets logging verbosity (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG). For example, `-e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` will set logging to debug mode.
| TAGS | Sets host tags as a comma delimited string. You can pass both simple tags and key-value tags. For example, `-e TAGS="simple-tag, tag-key:tag-value"`. |
| EC2_TAGS | Enabling this feature allows the agent to query and capture custom tags set using the EC2 API during startup. To enable, set the value to "yes", for example, `-e EC2_TAGS=yes`. Note that this feature requires an [IAM role][8] associated with the instance. |
| NON_LOCAL_TRAFFIC | Enabling this feature will allow statsd reporting from any external IP. For example, `-e NON_LOCAL_TRAFFIC=yes`. This can be used to report metrics from other containers or systems. See [network configuration][9] for more details.
| PROXY_HOST, PROXY_PORT, PROXY_USER, PROXY_PASSWORD | Sets proxy configuration details. For more information, see the [Agent proxy documentation][10] |
| SD_BACKEND, SD_CONFIG_BACKEND, SD_BACKEND_HOST, SD_BACKEND_PORT, SD_TEMPLATE_DIR, SD_CONSUL_TOKEN | Enables and configures Autodiscovery. For more information, please see the [Autodiscovery guide][11]. |

**Note**: Add `--restart=unless-stopped` if you want your agent to be resistant to restarts.

#### Running the agent container on Amazon Linux

To run the Datadog Agent container on Amazon Linux, you'll need to make one small change to the `cgroup` volume mount location:

```
docker run -d --name dd-agent \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  -v /proc/:/host/proc/:ro \
  -v /cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
  -e API_KEY={YOUR API KEY} \
  datadog/docker-dd-agent:latest
```

#### Alpine Linux based container

Our standard Docker image is based on Debian Linux, but as of version 5.7 of the Datadog Agent, we also offer an [Alpine Linux][12] based image. The Alpine Linux image is considerably smaller in size than the traditional Debian-based image. It also inherits Alpine's security-oriented design.

To use the Alpine Linux image, simply append `-alpine` to the version tag. For example:

```
docker run -d --name dd-agent \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  -v /proc/:/host/proc/:ro \
  -v /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
  -e API_KEY={YOUR API KEY} \
  datadog/docker-dd-agent:latest-alpine
```

#### Image versioning
Starting with version 5.5.0 of the Datadog Agent, the docker image follows a new versioning pattern. This allows us to release changes to the Docker image of the Datadog Agent but with the same version of the Agent.

The Docker image version will have the following pattern: **X.Y.Z** where **X** is the major version of the Docker Image, **Y** is the minor version, **Z** will represent the Agent version.

For example, the first version of the Docker image that will bundle the Datadog Agent 5.5.0 will be: `10.0.550`

#### Custom containers and additional information

For more information about building custom Docker containers with the Datadog Agent, the Alpine Linux based image, versioning, and more, please reference [our `docker-dd-agent` project on Github][1].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][13] and look for `docker_daemon` under the Checks section.

## Agent v6 

The new docker check is named `docker`. Starting from version 6.0, the Agent won't load the `docker_daemon` check anymore, even if it is still available and maintained for Agent version 5.x. All features are ported on version >6.0 , excepted the following deprecations:

  * the `url`, `api_version` and `tags*` options are deprecated, direct use of the [standard docker environment variables][14] is encouraged.
  * the `ecs_tags`, `performance_tags` and `container_tags` options are deprecated. Every relevant tag is now collected by default.
  * the `collect_container_count` option to enable the `docker.container.count` metric is not supported. `docker.containers.running` and `.stopped` are to be used.

Some options have moved from `docker_daemon.yaml` to the main `datadog.yaml`:

  * `collect_labels_as_tags` has been renamed `docker_labels_as_tags` and now supports high cardinality tags, see the details in `datadog.yaml.example`
  * `exclude` and `include` lists have been renamed `ac_include` and `ac_exclude`. In order to make filtering consistent accross all components of the agent, we had to drop filtering on arbitrary tags. The only supported filtering tags are `image` (image name) and `name` (container name). Regexp filtering is still available, see `datadog.yaml.example` for examples
  * `docker_root` option has been split in two options `container_cgroup_root` and `container_proc_root`
  * `exclude_pause_container` has been added to exclude pause containers on Kubernetes and Openshift (default to true). This will avoid removing them from the exclude list by error

The [`import`][15] command converts the old `docker_daemon.yaml` to the new `docker.yaml`. The command also moves needed settings from `docker_daemon.yaml` to `datadog.yaml`.

## Data Collected

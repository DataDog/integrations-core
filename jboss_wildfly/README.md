### Configuration

1. Edit the `jboss_wildfly.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your
   Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your JBoss or WildFly application server's
   performance data. See the [sample jboss_wildfly.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

   This check has a limit of 350 metrics per instance. The number of returned metrics is indicated in the info page.
   You can specify the metrics you are interested in by editing the configuration below. 
   To learn how to customize the collected metrics, visit the [JMX Checks documentation][4] for more detailed instructions.
   If you need to monitor more metrics, contact [Datadog support][8].

# Agent Check: Ambari

## Overview

This check monitors [Ambari][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

### Installation

The Ambari check is included in the [Datadog Agent][6] package.
No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `ambari.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to
start collecting your Ambari performance data. See the [sample ambari.d/conf.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][3].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][4] and look for `ambari` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

If host metrics collection is enabled with `collect_host_metrics` this integration collects for every host in every
cluster the following system metrics:

* boottime
* cpu
* disk
* memory
* load
* network
* process

If service metrics collection is enabled with `collect_service_metrics` this integration collects for each whitelisted
service component the metrics with headers in the white list.

### Metrics

If host metrics collection is enabled with `collect_host_metrics` this integration will collect

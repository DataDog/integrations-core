  # By default, we only capture *some* of the metrics available in the
  # `sys.dm_os_performance_counters` table. You can easily add additional
  # metrics by following the custom_metrics structure shown below.
  #
  # In order to connect to SQL Server either enable SQL Authentication and
  # specify a username or password below. If you do not specify a username
  # or password then we will connect using integrated authentication.
  #
  # custom_metrics:

    # This is a basic custom metric. There is not instance associated with
    # this counter.
    #
    # - name: sqlserver.clr.execution
    #   counter_name: CLR Execution

    # This counter has multiple instances associated with it and we're
    # choosing to only fetch the 'Cumulative execution time (ms) per second' instance.
    #
    # - name: sqlserver.exec.in_progress
    #   counter_name: OLEDB calls
    #   instance_name: Cumulative execution time (ms) per second

    # This counter has multiple instances associated with it and we want
    # every instance available. We'll use the special case ALL instance
    # which *requires* a value for "tag_by". In this case, we'll get metrics
    # tagged as "db:mydb1", "db:mydb2".
    #
    # - name: sqlserver.db.commit_table_entries
    #   counter_name: Log Flushes/sec
    #   instance_name: ALL
    #   tag_by: db

    # Additional counters can be retrieved from the following tables:
    #   sys.dm_os_wait_stats
    #   sys.dm_os_memory_clerks
    #   sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats

    # - name: sqlserver.wait_LCK_M_S
    #   counter_name: LCK_M_S
    #   table: sys.dm_os_wait_stats 

    # counters from the sys.dm_os_memory_clerks table will be tagged by the
    # memory_node_id.  Retrieve multiple counters by listing
    # which column(s) to retrieve.  The metric name will have the column
    # name appended (the example below will create two metrics,
    # sqlserver.MEMORYCLERK_SQLBUFFERPOOL.pages_kb and
    # sqlserver.MEMORYCLERK_SQLBUFFERPOOL.virtual_memory_reserved_kb)
    # - name: sqlserver.MEMORYCLERK_SQLBUFFERPOOL
    #   counter_name: MEMORYCLERK_SQLBUFFERPOOL
    #   table: sys.dm_os_memory_clerks
    #   columns:
    #     - pages_kb
    #     - virtual_memory_reserved_kb

    # counters from the sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats table will be tagged by 
    # database_id and file_id.  Retrieve multiple counters by listing
    # which column(s) to retrieve.  The metric name will have the column
    # name appended (the example below will create two metrics,
    # sqlserver.IoFileStats.num_of_reads and sqlserver.IoFileStats.num_of_writes)
    # - name: sqlserver.IoFileStats
    #   counter_name: num_of_reads
    #   table: sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats
    #   database_id: 1
    #   columns:
    #     - num_of_reads
    #     - num_of_writes

    # All '%' characters must be escaped as '%%'.

  - host: HOST,PORT
    # Optional, change the connection method from adodbapi (the default) to
    # odbc (valid connector names are 'odbc' and 'adodbapi')
    # connector: odbc

    # Optional, if using odbc, use the named driver.  If none is specified,
    # the 'SQL Server' driver will be used
    # driver: SQL Server

    # Optional, if using odbc, configure a connection using a DSN
    # dsn: DSN_NAME
    username: my_username
    password: my_password
    
    # Optional, timeout in seconds for the connection and each command run
    # command_timeout: 30

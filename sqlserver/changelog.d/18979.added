Add lookback_window config parameter to query_metrics.

The current lookback window defaults to 2 times the collection interval, and is not able to be overridden.
This means that infrequently-run queries are unlikely to have metrics captured for them. One common
use case that falls into this bucket is ETL queries which can run hourly or even daily. These have
a very small chance of having metrics captured for them. In that case, we will support setting a lookback
window that will include such queries.

          description: |
            By default, plan collection stops if it is time for the next run of the query metrics & plans loop. This
            means that some plans may not be collected. If it is necessary to collect all of the plans and in doing so
            cause delays in collecting query metrics, then this deadline can be disabled by setting this option to

            different DMV tables such as `dm_exec_requests`, `dm_exec_sessions`, and `dm_exec_sql_text`.
            If a non-default value is chosen, then that exact same value must be used for *every* check instance.
            Running different instances with different collection intervals is not supported.

# How to setup a test environment for MapR


Create multiple VMs (on gcp in an instance group for example) running CentOS 7.
Note: You'll need at least 32GB of memory per VM, yes 32GB.
Run this script on all the VMs:
```
sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
curl https://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/mapr-setup.sh -o /tmp/mapr-setup.sh
```

You can then ssh into one node and follow the process described [here](https://mapr.com/docs/61/MapRInstaller.html) to
start the installer, it starts a web interface from which you can start to actually install MapR on every node
in the cluster.

# Amazon EKS Integration

![EKS Dashboard][1]

## Overview

Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) is the latest addition to AWS, a managed Kubernetes service that automates certain aspects of deployment and maintenance for any standard Kubernetes environment. Whether you are migrating an existing Kubernetes application to EKS, or are deploying a new cluster, Datadog helps you monitor your EKS environment in real time.

## Setup

Because Datadog already integrates with Kubernetes and AWS, it is ready-made to monitor EKS. If you're running the Agent in a Kubernetes cluster and plan to migrate to EKS, you can continue monitoring your cluster with Datadog. [AWS EKS Managed Node Groups][2] are also supported.

### Metric collection

Monitoring EKS requires that you set up the Datadog integrations for:

* [Kubernetes][3]
* [AWS][4]
* [AWS EC2][5]

along with integrations for any other AWS services you're running with EKS (e.g., [ELB][6])

### Log collection

**Available for Agent >6.0**

The setup is exactly the same as for Kubernetes.
To start collecting logs from all your containers, use your Datadog Agent [environment variables][7].

Take also advantage of DaemonSets to [automatically deploy the Datadog Agent on all your nodes][8].

Follow the [container log collection steps][9] to learn more about those environment variables and discover more advanced setup options.

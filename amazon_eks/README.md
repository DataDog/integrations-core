# Amazon EKS Integration

![EKS Dashboard][1]

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that automates certain aspects of deployment and maintenance for any standard Kubernetes environment. Whether you are migrating an existing Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS, or are deploying a new cluster on Amazon EKS on AWS Outposts, Datadog helps you monitor your EKS environments in real time.

## Setup

Because Datadog already integrates with Kubernetes and AWS, it is ready-made to monitor EKS. If you're running the Agent in a Kubernetes cluster and plan to migrate to EKS, you can continue monitoring your cluster with Datadog. 

Additionally, [Amazon EKS Managed Node Groups][2] and [Amazon EKS on AWS Outposts][3] are supported.

### Metric collection

Monitoring EKS requires that you set up the Datadog integrations for:

- [Kubernetes][4]
- [AWS][5]
- [AWS EC2][6]

along with integrations for any other AWS services you're running with EKS (e.g., [ELB][7])

### Log collection

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

The setup is exactly the same as for Kubernetes.
To start collecting logs from all your containers, use your Datadog Agent [environment variables][8].

Take also advantage of DaemonSets to [automatically deploy the Datadog Agent on all your nodes][9].

Follow the [container log collection steps][10] to learn more about those environment variables and discover more advanced setup options.

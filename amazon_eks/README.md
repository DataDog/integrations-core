## Overview

Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) is the latest addition to AWS, a managed Kubernetes service that automates certain aspects of deployment and maintenance for any standard Kubernetes environment. Whether you are migrating an existing Kubernetes application to EKS, or are deploying a new cluster, Datadog helps you monitor your EKS environment in real time.

## Setup

Because Datadog already integrates with Kubernetes and AWS, it is ready-made to monitor EKS. If you're running the Agent in a Kubernetes cluster and plan to migrate to EKS, you can continue monitoring your cluster with Datadog. 

Monitoring EKS requires that you set up the Datadog integrations for:

* [Kubernetes][1]
* [AWS][2]
* [AWS EC2][3]

along with integrations for any other AWS services you're running with EKS (e.g., [ELB][4]).

      # If Consul setup uses SSL, you might need to set the following options as well.

      # You can specify a local cert to use as client side certificate
      # as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate concatenated)
      # client_cert_file: '/path/to/client.concatenated.pem'

      # client_cert_file: '/path/to/client.cert.pem'
      # private_key_file: '/path/to/private.key.pem'

      # watch for itself to become the leader and will emit an event when that
      # happens. It is safe/expected to enable this on all nodes in a consul
      # cluster since only the new leader will emit the (single) event. This

      # you will receive one event per leader change per instance. See

      # consul network coordinates will be retrieved and latency calculated for
      # each node and between data centers.

      # Services to restrict catalog querying to
      # The default settings query up to 50 services. So if you have more than

      # whitelist
      # service_whitelist:
      #   - zookeeper
      #   - gunicorn
      #   - redis

      # If you'd rather not maintain a whitelist, you can increase the maximum
      # number of queried services
      # max_services: 50

## Log Section (Available for Agent >=6.0)

#logs:

    # - type : (mandatory) type of log input source (tcp / udp / file)
    #   port / path : (mandatory) Set port if type is tcp or udp. Set path if type is file
    #   service : (mandatory) name of the service owning the log
    #   source : (mandatory) attribute that defines which integration is sending the logs
    #   sourcecategory : (optional) Multiple value attribute. Can be used to refine the source attribute
    #   tags: (optional) add tags to each logs collected

    # - type: file
    #   path: /var/log/consul_server.log
    #   source: consul

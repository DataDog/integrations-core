      description: |
        Where your Consul HTTP server lives,
        point the URL at the leader to get metrics about your Consul cluster.
        Use HTTPS instead of HTTP if your Consul setup is configured to do so.
      value:
        type: string
        example: http://localhost:8500
    - name: catalog_checks
      description: Set to true to perform checks against the Consul service Catalog.
      value:
        type: boolean
        example: false
    - name: network_latency_checks
      description: |
        Whether to enable network latency metrics collection. When enabled
        consul network coordinates is retrieved and latency calculated for
        each node and between data centers.
        See https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/coordinates.html
      value:
        type: boolean
        example: false

    - name: self_leader_check
      description: |
        Whether to enable self leader checks. Each instance with this enabled
        watches for itself to become the leader and emits an event when that
        happens. It is safe/expected to enable this on all nodes in a consul
        cluster since only the new leader emits the (single) event. This
        flag takes precedence over new_leader_checks.
      value:
        type: boolean
        example: false

    - name: acl_token
      description: ACL token to use for authentication.

        type: string

    - name: single_node_install
      description: |
        Whether or not to perform the full check even when not the leader. Useful
        if you don't want to install the Agent on every node in a data center.
      value:
        type: boolean
        example: false

    - name: new_leader_checks
      description: |
        Whether to enable new leader checks from this instance
        Note: if this is set on multiple instances/agents in the same cluster
        you will receive one event per leader change per instance. See
        self_leader_check for a more robust option.
      value:
        type: boolean
        example: false

    - name: service_whitelist
      description: |
        Services to restrict catalog querying to
        The default settings query up to 50 services. So if you have more than
        this many in your Consul service catalog, fill this whitelist.
      value:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
        example:

        Increase the maximum number of queried services.

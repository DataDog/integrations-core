  -
    ## @param server - string - optional
    ## The server with which to connect, defaulting to the local machine.
    #
    # server: <SERVER>

    ## @param username - string - optional
    ## The username used to connect to the `server`.

    ## @param enable_health_service_check - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Whether or not to send a service check named `<NAMESPACE>.windows.perf.health`, which reports
    ## the health of the `server`.
    #
    # enable_health_service_check: true

    ## @param server_tag - string - optional
    ## The name used for tagging `server`. The value defined here replaces the `server:` tag key.
    #
    # server_tag: <SERVER_TAG>

    ## @param extra_metrics - mapping - optional
    ## This mapping defines which metrics to collect from the performance
    ## counters on the `server`. For more information, see:
    ## https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/perfctrs/about-performance-counters
    ##
    ## The top-level keys are the names of the desired performance objects:
    ##
    ##   metrics:
    ##     System:
    ##       <OPTION_1>: ...
    ##       <OPTION_2>: ...
    ##     LogicalDisk:
    ##       <OPTION_1>: ...
    ##       <OPTION_2>: ...
    ##
    ## The available performance object options are:
    ##
    ##   name (required): This becomes the prefix of all metrics submitted for each counter.
    ##   counters (required): This is the list of counters to collect.
    ##   tag_name: This is the name of the tag used for instances. For example, if the tag name for
    ##             the `LogicalDisk` performance object is `disk`, a possible tag would be `disk:C`.
    ##             If not set, the default tag name is `instance`.
    ##   include: This is the list of regular expressions used to select which instances to monitor.
    ##            If not set, all instances are monitored.
    ##   exclude: This is the list of regular expressions used to select which instances to ignore.
    ##            If not set, no instances are ignored. Note: `_Total` instances are always ignored.
    ##   instance_counts: This is a mapping used to select the count of instances to submit, where each
    ##                    key is a count type and the value is the metric name to use, ignoring `name`.
    ##                    The `total` count type represents the total number of encountered instances.
    ##                    The `monitored` count type represents the number of monitored instances after
    ##                    `include`/`exclude` filtering. The `unique` count type represents the number
    ##                    of unique instance names that are monitored.
    ##   use_localized_counters: Whether or not performance object and counter names should refer to their
    ##                           locale-specific versions rather than by their English name. This overrides
    ##                           any defined value in `init_config`.
    ##
    ## The key for each counter object represents the name of the desired counter.
    ## Counters can be defined in the following ways:
    ##
    ## 1. Mapping the counter name to a string. If a value is a string, then it represents the suffix of the sent metric
    ##    name, for example:
    ##
    ##      counters:
    ##      - '% Free Space': usable
    ##      - Current Disk Queue Length: queue_length.current
    ##
    ## 2. Mapping the counter name to a set of options. If a value is a mapping, then it must have a `name` or
    ##    `metric_name` key that represents the suffix or full metric name of the
    ##    sent metric name, for example:
    ##
    ##      counters:
    ##      - '% Free Space':
    ##          name: usable
    ##          type: rate
    ##      - Current Disk Queue Length:
    ##          metric_name: queue_length.current
    ##          average: true
    ##
    ## The available counter options are:
    ##
    ##   type: This represents how the metric is handled, defaulting to `gauge`. The available types are:
    ##         gauge, rate, count, monotonic_count, service_check, temporal_percent, and time_elapsed.
    ##   average: When there are multiple values for the same instance name (for example, multiple processes
    ##            spawned with the same name) the check submits the sum. Setting this option to `true`
    ##            instructs the check to calculate the average instead.
    ##   aggregate: Whether or not to send an additional metric that is the aggregation of all values for
    ##              every monitored instance. If `average` is set to `true` the check submits the average as
    ##              a metric suffixed by `avg`, otherwise it submits the sum as a metric suffixed by `sum`.
    ##              If this is set to `only`, the check does not submit a metric per instance.
    ##   metric_name: This represents the full metric name in lieu of a `name` key and is not be prefixed by
    ##                the parent object's `name` key.

    ## @param tags - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of tags to attach to every metric and service check emitted by this instance.
    ##

    #
    # tags:
    #   - <KEY_1>:<VALUE_1>
    #   - <KEY_2>:<VALUE_2>

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Overrides any `service` defined in the `init_config` section.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

    ## @param min_collection_interval - number - optional - default: 15
    ## This changes the collection interval of the check. For more information, see:
    ## https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/write_agent_check/#collection-interval
    #
    # min_collection_interval: 15

    ## @param empty_default_hostname - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## This forces the check to send metrics with no hostname.
    ##
    ## This is useful for cluster-level checks.
    #
    # empty_default_hostname: false

    ## @param metric_patterns - mapping - optional
    ## A mapping of metrics to include or exclude, with each entry being a regular expression.
    ##
    ## Metrics defined in `exclude` will take precedence in case of overlap.
    #
    # metric_patterns:
    #   include:
    #   - <INCLUDE_REGEX>
    #   exclude:
    #   - <EXCLUDE_REGEX>

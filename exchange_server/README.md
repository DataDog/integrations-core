# exchange_check Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Microsoft Exchange Server

* Visualize and monitor Exchange server performance

## Setup
### Installation

The Exchange check is packaged with the Agent, so simply [install the Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your servers.  

If you need the newest version of the Exchange check, install the `dd-check-exchange_server` package; this package's check overrides the one packaged with the Agent. See the [integrations-core](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core#installing-the-integrations) repository for more details.

### Configuration

Edit the `exchange_server.yaml` file to collect Exchange Server performance data. See the [sample exchange_server.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/exchange_server/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/) and look for `exchange_server` under the Checks section:

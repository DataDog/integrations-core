# exchange_check Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Microsoft Exchange Server

* Visualize and monitor Exchange server performance

## Setup
### Installation

The Exchange check is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your servers.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `exchange_server.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Exchange Server performance data.  
  ```yaml
  init_config:

  instances:
    # "." means the current host
    - host: .
    #
    #   The additional metrics is a list of additional counters to collect.  The
    #   list is formatted as follows:
    #   ['<counterset name>', <counter instance name>, '<counter name>', <metric name>, <metric type>]
    #
    #   <counterset name>  is the name of the PDH Counter Set (the name of the counter)
    #   <counter instance name> is the specific counter instance to collect, for example
    #           "Default Web Site".  Specify 'none' For all instances of the counter.
    #   <counter name> is the individual counter to report
    #   <metric name> is the name you want to show up in Datadog
    #   <metric type> is from the standard choices for all agent checks, such as gauge,
    #       rate, histogram or counter
    #   
    #   additional_metrics:
    #     - - MSExchange Content Filter Agent
    #       - none
    #       - Messages that Bypassed Scanning
    #       - exchange.content_filter.bypassed_messages
    #       - gauge
  ```

2. [Restart the Agent][5]

# Agent Check: Slurm

## Overview

This check monitors [Slurm][1] through the Datadog Agent. 

Slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is an open-source workload manager used to schedule and manage jobs on large-scale compute clusters. It allocates resources, monitors job queues, and ensures efficient execution of parallel and batch jobs in high-performance computing environments.

The check collects metrics from the head node (`slurmctld`) by executing and parsing the output of several command-line binaries: [`sinfo`][8], [`squeue`][9], [`sacct`][10], [`sdiag`][11], and [`sshare`][12]. These commands provide detailed information about resource availability, job queues, accounting, diagnostics, and share usage in a Slurm-managed cluster.

On worker nodes, the check can also collect metrics using [`scontrol`][13], which provides process IDs (PIDs) and other job information that is not available through the head node.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. Since the Agent requires direct access to the various Slurm binaries, monitoring Slurm in containerized environments is not recommended.

**Note**: This check was tested on Slurm version 21.08.0.

### Installation

The Slurm check is included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package.
No additional installation is needed on your server.

### Configuration

#### Head Node

1. Ensure that the dd-agent user has execute permissions on the relevant command binaries and the necessary permissions to access the directories where these binaries are located.

2. Edit the `slurm.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Slurm data. See the [sample slurm.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

```yaml
init_config:

    ## Customize this part if the binaries are not located in the /usr/bin/ directory
    ## @param slurm_binaries_dir - string - optional - default: /usr/bin/
    ## The directory in which all the Slurm binaries are located. These are mainly:
    ## sinfo, sacct, sdiag, sshare and sdiag.

    slurm_binaries_dir: /usr/bin/

instances:

  -
    ## Configure these parameters to select which data the integration collects.
    ## @param collect_sinfo_stats - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Whether or not to collect statistics from the sinfo command.
    #
    collect_sinfo_stats: true

    ## @param collect_sdiag_stats - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Whether or not to collect statistics from the sdiag command.
    #
    collect_sdiag_stats: true

    ## @param collect_squeue_stats - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Whether or not to collect statistics from the squeue command.
    #
    collect_squeue_stats: true

    ## @param collect_sacct_stats - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Whether or not to collect statistics from the sacct command.
    #
    collect_sacct_stats: true

    ## @param collect_sshare_stats - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Whether or not to collect statistics from the sshare command.
    #
    collect_sshare_stats: true

    ## @param collect_gpu_stats - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## Whether or not to collect GPU statistics when Slurm is configured to use GPUs using sinfo.
    #
    collect_gpu_stats: true

    ## @param sinfo_collection_level - integer - optional - default: 1
    ## The level of detail to collect from the sinfo command. The default is 'basic'. Available options are 1, 2 and
    ## 3. Level 1 collects data only for partitions. Level 2 collects data from individual nodes. Level 3 
    ## collects data from from individual nodes as well but is more verbose and includes data such as CPU and 
    ## memory usage as reported from the OS, as well as additional tags.
    #
    sinfo_collection_level: 3

    ## @param collect_scontrol_stats - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## Whether or not to collect statistics from the scontrol command. This is mainly used in the worker 
    ## node to collect the list of running jobs along with their PIDs.
    collect_scontrol_stats: false # This should only be set on worker nodes and not the head node
```

3. [Restart the Agent][4].

#### Worker Nodes

The `slurm.scontrol.job.info` metric can only be collected from worker nodes. This metric enables the submission of important tags
that can be used to monitor the resource consumption of specific job steps.

1. Ensure that the dd-agent user has execute permissions on the relevant `scontrol` binaries and the necessary permissions to access the directories where these binaries are located.

2. Edit the `slurm.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Slurm data. See the [sample slurm.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.

```yaml
init_config:

    ## Customize this part if the binaries are not located in the /usr/bin/ directory
    ## @param slurm_binaries_dir - string - optional - default: /usr/bin/
    ## The directory in which all the Slurm binaries are located. These are mainly:
    ## sinfo, sacct, sdiag, and sshare.

    slurm_binaries_dir: /usr/bin/

instances:

  - 
    ## @param collect_scontrol_stats - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## Whether or not to collect statistics from the scontrol command. This is mainly used in the worker 
    ## node to collect the list of running jobs along with their PIDs.
    collect_scontrol_stats: true

    # The rest of these settings need to be turned off on the worker node because the information is specific
    # to the head node and isn't retrievable on the worker node.
    collect_sinfo_stats: false
    collect_sdiag_stats: false
    collect_squeue_stats: false
    collect_sacct_stats: false
    collect_sshare_stats: false
    collect_gpu_stats: false
    sinfo_collection_level: 1
```

3. [Restart the Agent][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `slurm` under the Checks section.

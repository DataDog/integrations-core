        collects data from from individual nodes as well but is more verbose and includes data such as CPU and 
        memory usage as reported from the OS, as well as additional tags.

          Most Slurm metrics are collected from calling the different binaries. Depending on the size of the Slurm cluster,
          this can be a very expensive operation. It is recommended to set this to a higher value than the default 15 
          seconds, but this can be adjusted based on the size of the cluster and the desired granularity of the metrics.

# Docusign

## Overview

[Docusign][1] is a digital transaction management service that provides electronic signature technology, allowing users to sign, send, and manage documents securely online. It streamlines the agreement process, making it faster and more efficient by eliminating the need for physical paperwork and in-person signing.

Docusign integration provides real-time insights into Docusign activities, such as envelope usage, template management, account events, and alerts generated by users.

## Setup

### Configuration

#### Prerequisites

- Docusign Developer Account, Account Type, Docusign Account Name, UserID, Integration Key, RSA Private Key (Refer to the [steps](#set-up-your-account) below)
- A Docusign account with a plan that includes Docusign Monitor

#### Set up your account

For first-time setup:

1. Go to the [Developer Center][2] and select **Developer Account**.
1. Choose **Create Account**. For first-time setup, the Account Type will be `Developer`.
1. Navigate to the [Developer Admin Console][3].
1. Under the **Account** section, click **Account Profile** .
1. From the **Account Name** section, copy the Docusign account name.
1. Under the **Integrations** section, select **Apps and Keys**.
1. From the **My Account Information** section, copy the **User ID**.
1. Click **Add App and Integration Key**.
1. Provide an app name and create the app.
1. Copy the generated **Integration Key**, under the General Info section.
1. Scroll to the Service Integration section, and click on **Generate RSA**.
1. Copy only the **RSA Private Key** to a safe location (it won't be displayed again).
1. In the **Additional settings** section, under **Redirect URIs**, click "Add URI."
1. Add the URI `http://localhost/`, and click **Save**.

For production account setup:

1. Ensure you have completed the [go-live][4] steps.
1. For the production account setup, the Account Type will be `Production`.
1. Navigate to the [Admin Console][5].
1. Under the **Account** section, click **Account Profile**.
1. From the **Account Name** section, copy the Docusign account name.
1. Under the **Integrations** section, select **Apps and Keys**.
1. Select the app that has been duplicated from your developer account.
1. Under the **General Info** section, find and copy the generated **Integration Key**.
1. Scroll to the **Service Integration** section, and click **Generate RSA**.
1. Copy only the **RSA Private Key** to a safe location (it won't be displayed again).
1. In the **Additional settings** section, under **Redirect URIs**, click "Add URI."
1. Add the URI `http://localhost/`, and click **Save**.

#### Obtain JWT consent

1. Construct your consent URI::
   - **Syntax:**`<BASE_URI>/oauth/auth?response_type=code&scope=signature impersonation organization_read&client_id=<YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY>&redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>`
     - Replace `<BASE_URI>`with:
       1. `https://account-d.docusign.com` for a developer account.
       2. `https://account.docusign.com` for production account.
     - Replace `<YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY>` with your Integration Key (Client ID).
     - Replace `<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>` with your redirect URI, such as `http://localhost/`.
2. Open the constructed URI in an embedded browser.
3. The user will be prompted to log in to their Docusign account (if not already logged in) and grant consent for your application to impersonate them with the specified scopes.
4. After consent is granted, Docusign will redirect the user's browser to your specified redirect URI with extra information in the URL, indicating successful consent without needing to use the extra parameters directly.
 

**Note:**
- For a localhost URI, the redirect will occur on the same page.
- The impersonated user must be a Docusign administrator or have the Security Reports Administrator permissions profile. For information about permission profiles, see [Docusign Administrator Permission Profiles][6] in the Organization Administrators topic.
- To ingest data from a [production account][7], complete the [Docusign go-live process][4]. After the go-live process, follow the [account setup steps](#set-up-your-account) to generate configuration information for your production account.

# Docusign

## Overview

[Docusign][1] is a digital transaction management service that provides electronic signature technology, allowing users to sign, send, and manage documents securely online. It streamlines the agreement process, making it faster and more efficient by eliminating the need for physical paperwork and in-person signing.

Docusign integration provides real-time insights into Docusign activities, such as envelope usage, template management, account events, and alerts generated by users.

## Setup

To integrate Docusign with Datadog, Datadog connects to Docusign using OAuth. The authenticated user must have owner permissions in the organizations that want to be integrated.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the [Integrations Page][2] and search for the "Docusign" integration.
2. Click the tile.
3. To add an account to install the integration, click the **Add Docusign Account** button.
4. After reading the instructions in the modal, click **Authorize**, which redirects you to the Docusign login page.
5. After logging in, you are prompted to select which Docusign organizations you want to grant access to, based on the organizations that your user account has access to.
6. Click **Authorize**.
7. You're redirected back to Datadog's Docusign tile with a new account. Datadog recommends changing the account name to something that is easier to remember. You can add multiple accounts with access to different organizations.

Note: Docusign saves this authorization selection. To be prompted again or add new organizations, revoke app access on Docusign (`Organization > Connected Apps > Datadog - Docusign OAuth App`), then restart the setup process.

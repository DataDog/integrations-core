        This check uses the latest OpenMetrics V2 implementation for more features and better performance.

        example: false
        type: boolean
      description: |
        This parameter instructs the check to send events on status changes in the backend.
        This is DEPRECATED in favor of the creation of a monitor on the service check status
        and will be removed in a future version.

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.
    - name: collect_aggregates_only
      value:
        anyOf:
          - type: boolean
          - type: string
        example: true
      description: |
        This parameter instructs the check to collect metrics only from the aggregate frontend/backend
        status lines from the stats output instead of for each backend. With this parameter set to false the agent
        collects data for each backend but ignores the aggregated data for backends. Because some metrics are only
        available for aggregates, you can also set this parameter to the string 'both' to collect everything.
        Please note that this mean that if if you have queries like computing the sum of all requests being made, the
        result will be twice as expected. To get the correct result, you have to explicitly add some filters to the
        query.

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.
    - name: collect_status_metrics
      value:
        example: false
        type: boolean
      description: |
        This parameter instructs the check to collect metrics on status counts (e.g. haproxy.count_per_status)

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.
    - name: collect_status_metrics_by_host
      value:
        example: false
        type: boolean
      description: |
        This parameter instructs the check to collect status metrics per host instead of per service.
        This only applies if `collect_status_metrics` is true.

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.
    - name: collate_status_tags_per_host
      value:
        example: true
        type: boolean
      description: |
        This parameter collects `status` tags for `haproxy.count_per_status` up to one of
        (`available`, `unavailable`) for each discovered backend.

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.
    - name: count_status_by_service
      value:
        example: true
        type: boolean
      description: |
        This parameter instructs the check to tag the status counts it collects by service in addition to by host.
        This only applies if `collect_status_metrics` is `true`.

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.
    - name: tag_service_check_by_host
      value:
        example: false
        type: boolean
      description: |
        This parameter instructs the check to tag the service check status by host on top of other tags.
        The default case will only tag by backend and service.

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.

          type: string

        Filter metrics by services. If a tag matches an exclude rule, it won't be included
        unless it also matches an include rule.

        to `haproxy_service` and disable the associated deprecation warning.

    - name: active_tag
      value:
        example: false
        type: boolean
      description: |
        Includes the 'active' tag to metrics to denote whether a backend belongs to the
        "active" pool of connections normally used for servicing requests.

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.

    - name: tags_regex
      value:
        type: string
      description: |
        This parameter instructs the check to use the defined named regex for creating
        additional tags based on the name of the HAProxy service.

         tags_regex: 'be_edge_http_(?P<team>[a-z]+)\-(?P<env>[a-z]+)_(?P<app>.*)'

        would match service name be_edge_http_sre-prod_elk and include additional
        tags: ['team:sre','env:prod','app:elk']

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.
    - name: startup_grace_seconds
      value:
        example: 0
        type: number
      description: |
        Time to wait on startup or reload of haproxy before sending metrics

        When haproxy reloads, if there is a `grace` period on some proxies, 2
        haproxies will stay running for that period, possibly including the
        stats endpoint. Stats returned by haproxy during this period will only
        refer to one of the multiple instances of haproxy, and will not
        accurately reflect the state of the system.
        If this parameter is >0, no datapoints will be sent until the uptime of
        haproxy reaches this many seconds.

        NOTE: This only takes effect when `use_openmetrics` is set to `false`.

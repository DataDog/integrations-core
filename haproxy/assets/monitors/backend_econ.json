    "message": "There is a higher number of backend connection failures for host: {{host.name}}\n\nNote: This monitored metric doesn't only includes failed backend requests but additionally includes general backend errors, like a backend without an active frontend. Correlating this metric with `haproxy.backend.errors.resp_rate` and response codes from both your frontend and backend servers will give you a better idea of the causes of an increase in backend connection errors.",

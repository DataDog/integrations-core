## OpenTelemetry Collector

## Overview

The OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic agent process that, via the Datadog exporter, exports telemetry data directly to Datadog servers (no Agent installation required). It reports metrics and traces from instrumented applications as well as general system metrics.

Host metrics will be shown in the default dashboard, but you can send arbitrary metrics to Datadog using the OpenTelemetry Collector. Metrics under `system.*` and `process.*`, such as those generated by the host metrics receiver, are renamed to `otel.system.*` and `otel.process.*` respectively to prevent collisions with metrics from the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

### Installation

Follow the [OpenTelemetry Collector documentation][1] to install the `opentelemetry-collector-contrib` distribution, or any other distribution that includes the Datadog exporter.

The Datadog Agent is **not** needed to export telemetry data to Datadog.

### Configuration

To export telemetry data to Datadog from the OpenTelemetry Collector, add the Datadog exporter to your metrics and traces pipelines.
The only required setting is [your API key][2].

A minimal configuration file to retrieve system metrics is as follows.

``` yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    scrapers:
      load:
      cpu:
      disk:
      filesystem:
      memory:
      network:
      paging:
      process:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  datadog:
    api:
      key: "<Your API key goes here>"
      
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [datadog]
```

For further information on the Datadog exporter settings and how to configure the pipeline, visit the [Datadog exporter for OpenTelemetry Collector documentation][3].

See [the Metrics section](#metrics) for a list of metrics that are provided by this check, if you're using the `hostmetrics` receiver as in the sample configuration above. You can send arbitrary metrics with other OpenTelemetry Collector components.

Different groups of metrics can be enabled and customized by following the [hostmetrics receiver instructions][4].
CPU and disk metrics are not available on macOS.

### Validation

Check the OpenTelemetry Collector logs to see the Datadog exporter being enabled and started correctly.
For example, with the configuration above you should find logging messages similar to the following.

``` 
Exporter is enabled.	{"component_kind": "exporter", "exporter": "datadog"}
Exporter is starting...	{"component_kind": "exporter", "component_type": "datadog", "component_name": "datadog"}
Exporter started.	{"component_kind": "exporter", "component_type": "datadog", "component_name": "datadog"}
Everything is ready. Begin running and processing data.
```

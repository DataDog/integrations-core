        The admin endpoint to connect to. It must be accessible:
        https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin
        Add a `?usedonly` on the end if you wish to ignore
        unused metrics instead of reporting them as `0`.

        Includes metrics using regular expressions.
        The filtering occurs before tag extraction, so you have the option
        to have certain tags decide whether or not to keep or ignore metrics.
        For an exhaustive list of all metrics and tags, see:
        https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/envoy/datadog_checks/envoy/metrics.py

        If you surround patterns by quotes, be sure to escape backslashes with an extra backslash.

        The example list below will include:
          - cluster.in.0000.lb_subsets_active
          - cluster.out.alerting-event-evaluator-test.datadog.svc.cluster.local

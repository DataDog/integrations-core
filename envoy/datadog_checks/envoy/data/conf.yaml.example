instances:
  # For every instance, you need a `stats_url` and can optionally
  # supply a list of tags. The admin endpoint must be accessible.
  # https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin

  # Add a `?usedonly` on the end if you wish to ignore
  # unused metrics instead of reporting them as `0`.
  - stats_url: http://localhost:80/stats

  #   tags:
  #     - instance:foo

  # You can also whitelist/blacklist metrics using regular expressions.
  # The filtering occurs before tag extraction, so you have the option
  # to have certain tags decide whether or not to keep or ignore metrics.
  # For an exhaustive list of all metrics and tags, see:
  # https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/envoy/datadog_checks/envoy/metrics.py
  #
  # If you surround patterns by quotes, be sure to
  # escape backslashes with an extra backslash.
  #
  # metric_whitelist:
  #   - cluster\.(in|out)\..*
  #
  # metric_blacklist:
  #   - ^http\..*
  #
  # Results are cached by default to decrease CPU utilization, at
  # the expense of some memory. Disable by setting this to false.
  #
  # cache_metrics: true

  # <<<Note>>> The Envoy admin endpoint does not support auth until:
  # https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/2763
  # For an alternative, see:
  # https://gist.github.com/ofek/6051508cd0dfa98fc6c13153b647c6f8
  #
  # If the stats page is behind basic auth:
  # username: USERNAME
  # password: PASSWORD

  # The (optional) verify_ssl parameter instructs the check to validate SSL
  # certificates when connecting to Envoy. Defaulting to true, set to false if
  # you want to disable SSL certificate validation.
  #
  # verify_ssl: true

  # The (optional) skip_proxy parameter bypasses any proxy
  # settings enabled and attempt to reach Envoy directly.
  #
  # skip_proxy: false

  # If you need to specify a custom timeout in seconds (default is 20):
  # timeout: 20
